<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Happy National Pet Day! Share a photo of your pet enjoying Yosemite to celebrate! If you’re planning to take your pet with you to Yosemite National Park, keep your trip paw-some by preparing and following the B.A.R.K. Ranger code:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>Bag it and toss it. Don’t leave your pet’s business behind. Bring plenty of bags, pick all waste up, and toss it in the trash. It's a simple way to keep the park fur-ever clean!</li>
<li>Always leash your pet (even when posing for pictures) and never leave them unattended. A leash is the "leash" you can do to help the park!</li>
<li>Respect nature’s residents. The sight of dogs can scare animals, from grazing deer to nesting birds and rodents hidden in meadow grasses. Be sure to give them distance, stay on paved trails, and out of their homes.</li>
<li>Know where you can go. Pets are welcome in developed areas, on paved roads, sidewalks, bicycle paths, and in most campgrounds (except walk-in and group sites.) Pets CAN’T join you in wilderness areas, on unpaved trails, on shuttle buses, or inside buildings. Be sure to "paws" and check signs for any special areas with pet restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Want to be a part of the B.A.R.K. Ranger crew? Stop by any Yosemite visitor center to pick up an official pledge card! Follow the code, complete pet-themed activities, sign your pledge, and purchase an official B.A.R.K Ranger badge at any Yosemite Conservancy bookstore.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thank you for working to keep both your pet and the park safe!

Final snow survey results are in! Rangers completing the April 1 survey found the Merced River basin at 75% of average and the Tuolumne River basin at 72% of average, based on the snow's water content. Although the April snow survey is usually completed when snowpack is at its peak, more snow has fallen since measurements were taken. Warmer, drier days are on the way, and spring weather will play a large role in determining conditions this summer.<br>
The Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers helped to complete some of these snow surveys. Read more about it in their weekly post: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-wednesday-april-2-2025.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-wednesday-april-2-2025.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-wednesday-april-2-2025.htm</a>.<br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Two sides of spring, one day apart. 🌦️<br data-text="true">
<br>
Spring in Yosemite National Park has been like a pendulum, constantly swinging between sunshine and snowstorms. One day, the sun’s light bathed Yosemite Valley in golden rays, coaxing vibrant flowers to burst open alongside overflowing streams and rivers. Then, a day later, the landscape transformed. A thick blanket of snow enveloped the landscape, and the flowers that basked in the sunlight a day before lied dormant beneath a delicate layer of snow. The duality of spring in Yosemite is more than a seasonal shift; it’s a demonstration of life’s ebbs and flows and a unique challenge presented by nature to embrace the volatility of such a dynamic ecosystem.<br data-text="true">
<br>
As temperatures rise and days become consistently warmer, green will once more begin to grace the Valley meadows as snowmelt saturated waterfalls thunder in the distance. But whether you’re chasing sunbeams or catching snowflakes, be sure to check the weather forecast before entering the park. To learn more about the wonders of visiting Yosemite in April, go to <a href="/yose/planyourvisit/april.htm" id="CP___PAGEID=244499,april.htm,550|">www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/april.htm </a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tuolumne Meadows got a sneak peek of spring as temperatures climbed to 60°F last week. As the snow melted away, nature unveiled a spectacular symphony of warm weather. Creeks, dormant for months, opened with a babble. Once-stable snow bridges gave way with a rumble and avalanching from high-altitude, granite domes and cliffs thundered in the distance.<br>
<br>
Rushing water echoed through the air, mixing with the chatter of birdlife. Dark-eyed juncos and American robins gave staccato trills while sooty grouses punctuated the song with a baritone call. At night, the howls of the coyotes danced through starry skies.<br>

Our winter rangers enjoyed this brief spring interlude while it lasted, savoring as much as possible before this week's winter weather settled back into the Sierra Nevada.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">“Along the river, over the hills, in the ground, in the sky, spring work is going on with joyful enthusiasm…new birds in their nests, new winged creatures in the air, and new leaves, new flowers, spreading, shining, rejoicing everywhere.” – John Muir<br>
<br>
Today is the first day of spring, also known as the vernal equinox. This day signifies one of the two times each year when the sun aligns with the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly the same amount of sunlight and darkness at all latitudes. After the spring equinox, days will gradually become longer than nights until the summer solstice in June.<br>
<br>
As we transition from March to April, visitors may start to see signs of spring throughout the park. Meadows will awaken and begin to turn green, attracting wildlife like bears, deer, and birds as they forage for food. Warmer temperatures will melt high-elevation snow, causing waterfalls, creeks, and rivers to rush with water.<br>
<br>
Flowers will also begin to blossom at lower elevations before spreading upwards into the Valley. If you’ve driven along Highway 140 beyond the Arch Rock entrance station this time of year, you might have noticed a tree covered in clusters of pinkish-purple flowers. This is the western redbud (Cercis occidentalis), a tree that’s actually a member of the pea family!<br>
<br>
As we undergo the changing of the seasons it’s important to remember that winter is lingering, especially at higher elevations. Glacier Point Road, Tioga Road, and Mariposa Grove Road are still closed due to snowy conditions. It’s not uncommon for the occasional storm to sweep through the park. Keep an eye on the weather before you visit!<br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This week might signal the arrival of spring, but winter is still very active at Tuolumne Meadows. After a relatively dry winter, our wilderness rangers measured an impressive 61 inches of snow and 3.57 inches of water over the past few days. That puts the central Sierra at a heartening 90% average for this time of year! Sometimes it’s hard to believe that all of this can come from something as small as a snowflake. But there’s no denying its power. As conditions get warmer, there could be a higher chance of avalanches in the following weeks. While the new powder gave skiers a run for their money, pine martens had no trouble darting across the snow, and golden eagles were spotted soaring above as they looked for their next meal.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This week, winter and spring clash in Tuolumne Meadows as the start of snowmelt is met with fresh storms. Just a few days ago, the smooth, granitic domes of the high country were starting to show “frowns,” which appear where the snow is starting to slip down the slope and expose the rock underneath. Additionally, there was music in the air as birds like the Cassin’s finch and a lone western meadowlark made their appearance. However, our winter rangers recorded an additional 10 inches of snow this week. And with the second in a series of storms bringing more on the horizon, it is hopeful that March will continue to add to the Sierra snowpack.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Have you ever walked through a forest in winter and noticed trees with dead leaves still hanging from their branches?<br>
<br>
Amongst the towering pines in Yosemite National Park, the California black oak stands out orange against green, its leaves clinging to its branches like stubborn memories of warmer days.These trees are winter deciduous, meaning they lose most of their leaves in fall and become dormant during the winter. But here’s the twist: while many trees gracefully let go of all of their foliage, the California black oak defiantly holds onto many of its dead leaves through winter and only lets go when spring growth pushes them off. This phenomenon is known as “marcescence.”<br>
<br>
Marcescence is an adaptation that is largely something scientists are still exploring. However, various theories offer a glimpse into its purpose. Some believe winter leaves provide protection for new buds and branches, guarding them against hungry deer. Buds hidden beneath these leaves are given a fighting chance to grow into foliage come spring. Another theory suggests that these clingy leaves play a role in moisture retention. More leaves mean more snow buildup, which eventually falls to the ground and melts into water for the tree’s roots to soak up happily. There’s even speculation that these leaves serve as a final gift of nutrients for the tree in spring, decomposing into a natural mulch that enriches the soil for the tree to feed off of.<br>
<br>
Regardless of the reasons, marcescence is a t-oak-ally impressive survival strategy that showcases the resilience and adaptability of the California black oak. Next time you wander through a winter forest, take a moment to appreciate these steadfast trees and the stories their stubborn leaves have to tell.  <br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Watch for falling rocks!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This rockfall onto the Big Oak Flat Road in April of 1948 is just one of thousands that have occurred in Yosemite’s historical time. Rockfalls are incredible natural events that shape Yosemite’s extraordinary landscapes, but they can also damage infrastructure and pose risk to people. You may have seen or heard a rockfall during a visit, but did you know that you can read stories from all of the park’s historical rockfalls online?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Geologists from the National Park Service and U.S. Geological Survey have updated Yosemite’s rockfall database through 2024. Interactive maps show rockfall locations and tell the accounts of rockfalls dating back to 1857. You can learn about when rockfalls have happened, how big they were, and what caused them, with triggers ranging from storms to earthquakes to thermal expansion. The maps include photos and videos, a time slider, and even a 3D map to explore.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Careful documentation of rockfalls improves our understanding of these complicated events, helping to increase public safety.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It’s Invasive Species Awareness Week!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Invasive species are species that have the ability to negatively affect ecosystems. At Yosemite, yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis) is one of the park’s peskiest invasive plants. Already widespread throughout California, this weed has become well-established in the Sierra Nevada foothills and is slowly trying to spread eastward into the park.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Wherever yellow star-thistle grows, it takes over the area and pushes other vegetation out. One single plant can disperse up to 150,000 seeds in a single season. Lightweight seeds carried on the wind get stuck to clothing, shoes, vehicle tires, and animal fur like horses and dogs. Those seeds then get dropped on the sides of roads or in the park, taking root easily and refusing to leave once grown.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In 2023, invasive plant crews treated many previously known yellow star-thistle infestations in Yosemite National Park and El Portal Administrative Site. After several years, yellow star-thistle density has undergone drastic reductions. And you can help, too! Check your boots, clothing, and pets for hitchhiking seeds, or volunteer to help with invasive plant removal in the summer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Yellow star-thistle isn’t the only invasive plant in Yosemite. Vegetation crews and volunteer groups work hard throughout the year to remove plants like the Himalayan blackberry, common velvet grass, Italian thistle, spotted knapweed, and more.

<br>
If you plan on visiting Yosemite National Park this weekend, be prepared for busy trails and traffic in the valley, especially around evening time. But never fear! There are ways to avoid the crowds and maximize your visit. Here are some of our top tips:<br>
<br>
<img alt="🌅" height="16" referrerpolicy="origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tce/3/16/1f305.png" width="16" title="🌅"> Arrive early and stay late. Due to the Horsetail Fall event, traffic congestion and crowds are common later in the afternoons. Expect evening traffic. Get on the trails earlier and leave after the crowds to keep your trip peaceful.<br>
<br>
<img alt="🚗" height="16" referrerpolicy="origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t2a/3/16/1f697.png" width="16" title="🚗"> Ditch your car, ride the shuttle! Parking is limited in the park, especially at parking lots close to the Horsetail Fall viewing area. Park your car for the duration of your stay and take the free shuttle around Yosemite Valley instead.<br>
<br>
<img alt="🧤" height="16" referrerpolicy="origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tbe/3/16/1f9e4.png" width="16" title="🧤"> Dress to impress. Weather may be warming up in the valley, but as the sun lowers, so do the temperatures. Bring warm clothing, especially if you are staying for the Horsetail Fall event and may be parked far from the viewing area. Bring a flashlight to light your way back.<br>
<br>
<img alt="🐻" height="16" referrerpolicy="origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t99/3/16/1f43b.png" width="16" title="🐻"> Safety is important…for you and the park’s natural and cultural resources! Please stay on trails and do not walk on the road. Stay out of meadows and limit your impacts by walking on the trail. Protect our wildlife by packing out any trash or using our trash and recycling dumpsters.<br>
<br>
<img alt="🧘" height="16" referrerpolicy="origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t23/3/16/1f9d8.png" width="16" title="🧘"> Remember to pack your patience. Crowds and traffic may be stressful, but it's important to take a moment to reset and breathe in that fresh mountain air.<br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The weather during the past week brought the biggest storm of the season to Tuolumne Meadows dropping 44 inches of new snow and 3.67 inches of snow water equivalent over a 48-hour period. Our winter rangers observed several old natural avalanches after the skies cleared. Currently, the most concerning problem type across the Sierra Nevada continues to be persistent slab layer(s). Learn more about ski, snow, and avalanche conditions, what bird Rob and Laura have been hearing daily, and soak in their moment of gratitude for this week: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-february-19-2025.htm">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-february-19-2025.htm</a>.  </p>

<p><strong>February 13, 2025</strong></p>
<p>Winter returned to Tuolumne Meadows over the past week, with 13 inches of fresh snow and more coming down now. A combination of new dense snow and cold temperatures (average low recently of -11°F), produced a supportable snow surface. However, the snowpack has also become more complex because of these weather conditions, so don’t be fooled by these apparent signs of snowpack stability as slab avalanche dangers exist and are troublesome to navigate.

<p>Traveling to Yosemite in the late 1800s was dangerous business. Sharp turns, steep drop-offs, and unwieldy horses sometimes led to terrible accidents. Stages weren’t exactly equipped with airbags and seatbelts.</p>
<p>Safe passage was highly dependent on the skill of your driver. If you were lucky, you would’ve been driven to and from Yosemite Valley by George Monroe, the most acclaimed stage driver to ever take the reins on Yosemite’s treacherous mountain roads. In his twenty-year career, he was never late and never injured a passenger. He was said to have exceptional skill with horses, which was indispensable for the job since stage drivers typically worked with at least 30. Thanks to his reputation, his employer, Henry Washburn, always had George drive Yosemite’s most prestigious visitors, including three U.S. presidents and many other influential figures.</p>

<p>This past week, Yosemite National Park experienced multiple days of precipitation in the form of rain and snow. Precipitation is one of the four main parts of the water cycle, a process that moves Earth’s water around the planet to places where plants, animals, and humans can use it. This process plays a significant role in the park, especially in winter.</p>
<p>At lower elevations, rain immediately runs into lakes and rivers, creating beautiful flowing waterfalls that cascade down the valley’s granite walls. These streams and waterfalls fill immediately, but little is saved for the dry summer ahead.<br>
At higher elevations, snow builds up to create a “snowpack” that melts slowly over time. Ecosystems from alpine gardens to giant sequoia groves rely on this vital savings account of frozen water, refilled each winter and drawn down during the spring and summer. Yosemite Falls, like many streams and waterfalls in the park, is fed almost entirely by snowmelt.</p>
<p>Precipitation might be leaving the valley for the weekend, but it will return next week and continue the cycle all over again! If you plan on visiting this weekend, a reservation is required for all visitors to drive into the park to manage the Horsetail Fall event. Reservations are available two days prior to a day-use reservation date beginning at 8 am PST at <a attributionsrc="/privacy_sandbox/comet/register/source/?xt=AZUd6xIvkvwIlrB7R6r_sQDiX9atrYwx8_4oX2CNPuU-c6iVt2cRGnByL5KhOPbGw2z911Br_0AEW6pxMHE_3d0cB12zyFRzMJTWJWkKUBm-drPg9_PwUnxS98cH5z-3oDVhq0MiGf3nPgBak4XxeEa90f2eKxzkHsocW939kn86MQIdhsq4mstJpGrbNVBRPip_3M44inEsBNdLZ1SU_2W2dtXuOjhQG4NM9Y--UOJpvvLgmmwQCgabIDvdnHVVUT0XC4vBCr0J1uqDFPEyGkVn9FFWWqcwHrks5eouVvS1V0cBAZHFgXMUwxpzOseo0yTln7O7Whk6DEwrIg4R1CkWj70n0-QHu96kFJQsM6brB-fmmygzjODpyx77dSsGIg7kLAoNOsYF04AKqBGvItJfYhI2m31VylGh69QCCOK_ymmvCMW7JT17FSidgVxwS0kIwJgyzn7nVU1nRSCaGync1aVnp8ojYR4PCGbt6-a-nhQgQxnDrF36L194NMVwjdHDOg16M6EdlVj7LRmmeoAtpVPnMuzqRWEKJHo9fQD7eBvp6OOBKDlrsroAmX0bqA4CYfgzL5Rr_fK7Ys7kIPz7p7zg10vC_f4AePfJBaRYzCB0z2qZMuV8M9RzWvgKtXD1-pzN04t4yFlrdRan354FG9Wbla-mrsm2xDmF5pozB6UFb1duEsy2DVQlPFWrI1Nb7I8EvZC2oklxFV8p6wov-NZ7u8bLVtpj4y2XWw_sFrkgU8P2e1gxOdlhIG0U07dwTsPgs-6AdyQ1cEXLAbIqFUXZeMfzXwyV2e9c0KYM4Dx3PyXDsQ1xTVjdPJVrSJNTxVXPcAlB_vTjhNdE50NbK2Lk3hcPCKbe-7RU9N5MPLHKn7KfS3LTdbESfsZI88gIVFwN32VC333WdxN702WKpb-NHn18AMXvuhzbuj3d1p3lstMQaJ3DLfdqv9lGm7_9zoEeuvJ48qdnnkxTi0o7y_cWgN1Yb6XiGiofYSPdipO7rLvd9q-4tIq9eaHG-v3KkhQ8Zwwh4fjK1xjNMyD-ttIDggdphgKsOxgKjfGNKV3lS5ax_gRSbxfzZO8b6yeh9etBZyOCVFU-2nKVrz2IGuNP9M1R48s9DIrYVNGcDufR3imKK6ydBZBY-lovsUkyyo2cMezTE4Bb4qMw0dOQfnEThXNDG_Th_7zUvkr2DaqYelbNWE7DEc6ZVvtEUxBkjSB2XtoN07Ykz8ZzVyyftHzAA2IzpqRQw2TZ5WuSlrGHc8Ow1tNWYgdq6Ds6AJpr-KLFzcoPnBHIqHFVjD8D1CYbvsM9HX42YNBUMvao8uAZrnTZ5BNvp3NtBVEfxV_oYaJHJsBYiZXaBL7n91LD44yUhPcfJ36N_iLl0c27Wk-jqBEd76KFa94BO3C2MK6WfFh23N_sCprAswqknDBvvGqftwJBrG-AyiYpIGOX9w" href="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3-PKaTSESGVOJB7ykc338W9pc25qxw3JzdPi65ghCTixYr8UOPAADFzvk_aem__a2Ve9y8nClMkQmcR3nEtg" rel="nofollow" role="link" tabindex="0" target="_blank">https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745</a>.<br>

<p><strong>February 6, 2025</strong></p>
<p>January was warmer and drier than average bringing 10 inches of new snow to the Tuolumne Meadows area. February started with a storm that mostly fell as rain in the high country, but the area received snow on Tuesday night. This week’s colder atmospheric river is expected to bring significant snow to the Sierra Nevada so we shall see what the data looks like next week!</p>
<p>Birds have been abundant in the Tuolumne Meadows area. Even prior to this recent rain event, the river and water ways were starting to melt. Dark-eyed juncos flitted about the partially thawed lake shores of Tenaya Lake. And an occasional Steller’s jay would be seen perching upon the exposed picnic tables both at Tenaya Lake and Tuolumne Meadows. We’ve also been hearing the hairy woodpecker drumming and squeaking from Tuolumne Meadows to Tioga Pass.</p>

<p>If you’re planning on driving to Yosemite in February, this is a reminder that day-use entrance reservations are required on February 8–9, February 15–17, and February 22–23 in order to manage the Horsetail Fall event. This is required for all visitors to the park. Initial reservations immediately sold out in November, but the remaining 50% of day-use reservations will be available two days prior to a day-use reservation date beginning at 8 am PST at <a aria-label="Link https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745." href="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745." id="menur1t0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745.">https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745.</a> For example, on February 21 at 8 am, day-use reservations for February 23 will be available.</p>
<p>If you have a lodging reservation for Yosemite Valley, Wawona, Foresta, or Yosemite West, you don’t need an additional entrance reservation.</p>
<p>Campground reservations will be required for Camp 4, Hodgdon Meadow, and Wawona Campgrounds from February 8 through February 23, 2025 (these campgrounds normally operate on a first-come, first-served basis in February). If you have a reservation for a campground inside the park, you don’t need an additional entrance reservation.</p>

<p>With 3 inches of new snow last week in Tuolumne Meadows, ski conditions improved slightly, but overall, still aren’t that good. Our winter rangers are heading out for the first snow surveys of the season, which they will complete monthly through winter and into early spring. They cover over 60 miles each month collecting data and measuring the snow’s average depth and density for each area/course. Learn more about current conditions, and wildlife sightings in this week’s update: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-29-2025.htm">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-29-2025.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Yosemite’s Historic Preservation Crew is looking for additional interns for the summer season through the Traditional Trades Advancement Program (TTAP). This internship offers participants hands-on experience in historic preservation trades, such as carpentry, masonry, and woodcraft. Interns work alongside skilled preservationists, learning techniques essential to maintaining the park's historic structures while contributing to their preservation. The mission of the Yosemite Historic Preservation Crew is to preserve and restore the park's historic structures, ensuring they remain integral parts of Yosemite's cultural and architectural heritage. By maintaining these historic buildings, the crew helps connect visitors to the park's rich past, while ensuring their continued use and appreciation for future generations. </p>
<p>While no experience is required, applicants should be prepared for moderate to heavy physical effort. This 6-month internship will begin in April. Applicants must be between 18-30 years of age (35 for Veterans with DD-214). Pay is $18 an hour plus an AmeriCorps Education award upon program completion. Housing is available if needed, and the position is based in El Portal, CA.

<p>This is the first week since our winter rangers arrived in Tuolumne Meadows that there is no new snow to report. Atypical winds were the driving force of this week’s weather. These sustained high winds can and have stripped loose surface snow, in places, all the way to bare ground, including from slopes that typically hold the deepest wind-loaded snow. That said, above 8,000 feet, skis, snowshoes, split boards, and/or traction devices are advised for safe travel in the Yosemite wilderness, where only non-mechanized travel is allowed. Learn more about current conditions, about the elusive horned larks, and think snow!</p>

<p>Mentorship is something that we see and can participate in at many points in our careers.  The National Park Service and Yosemite National Park are proud to be the host of many partner programs that encourage mentorship with young adults and those early in their conservation careers.  From trail building and maintenance, to developing and presenting programs, conducting scientific research, and providing vital services to our parks, there are a variety of avenues and interests to explore!

<p>For millennia humans have lived in, interacted with, and stewarded the landscapes in what today is known as Yosemite National Park. Tribes’ creation stories are tied to the landscape of Yosemite. The descendants of the first people maintain connections to the landscape through customary activities rooted in the traditions and histories of the tribes, including gathering plants for ceremonial use or sustenance.</p>
<p>We are initiating an opportunity for public comment on developing an Environmental Assessment (EA) for gathering plants and plant parts for traditional purposes by tribal members traditionally associated with Yosemite National Park. This plan will establish a framework for a plant gathering agreement which will help ensure tribes can collect native plant material legally, sustainably and in a traditional manner that protects and enhances tribal cultures and park resources.</p>
<p><strong>Public scoping comments will be accepted from January 13 through February 12, 2025.</strong> During the comment period share your insights on what the National Park Service should include in their analysis. Consider the potential effects (both beneficial and negative) from traditionally associated tribal members gathering and tending plants for traditional purposes.</p>

<p>On the evening of January 3, the Tuolumne Meadows area was treated to seven new inches of low-density snow that fell during a three-hour burst. The magnificent dynamic quality of snow demands that we accept the ever-changing nature of it. Prior to these seven inches of new snowfall, the old snow surface was either a breakable sun or wind crust which did not make for good skiing at all. In marked contrast, the three days following the snowfall were windless blue bird days with supportable snow, resulting in excellent ski conditions each day… until January 8, day four, which saw the wind machine crank up the northeast winds and change (this time for the worst) the ski conditions once again. As any skier will tell you, chasing good snow can be frustrating, but also fabulously rewarding!</p>

<p>“Another year over, and a new one just begun…” Last year on January 1 there was only 3 inches on the Tuolumne Meadows snow stake, and this year there were 31! With 8 inches of new snow last week, our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers are hoping for more to come, as the Sierra Nevada is the biggest natural reservoir we’ve got. Larger than Lake Mead and taller than Oroville Dam, these mountains hold much more liquid gold.

<p>Wind, sun and snow were the combo this week in the Yosemite high country. With every snowflake, ski conditions keep getting better. Check out their latest update to learn more about avalanche conditions, what wildlife our winter rangers are seeing, and what to be on the lookout for if you are planning a winter trip to the Tuolumne Meadows area: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-25-2024.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-25-2024.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-25-2024.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Join in welcoming our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers back home for another winter season. They skied into the high country on December 7 and met up with their cache containing five months’ worth of groceries and supplies which they stored during fall. Snow coverage is good, but the snowpack has some healing to do. It feels “bottomless” in many places, depending on aspect and elevation. The deepening of the snowpack this past week should help it to become more supportable. Only time will tell. Lucky for us, we’ll be getting weekly updates from Rob and Laura. Check out their first post of the season: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-18-2024.htm." id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-18-2024.htm.|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-18-2024.htm.</a></p>

<p>Ackerson Meadow’s makeover is almost complete…2024 was a big year! Ackerson Meadow, one of the largest publicly owned mid-elevation meadows in the Sierra Nevada, is home to the state-endangered great grey owl and little willow flycatcher, as well as a suite of additional at-risk wildlife. A century-old erosion gully network drained much of the wetlands in the meadow complex, so the goal of this project is to restore 103 acres of lost habitat and protect the remaining 84 acres of existing wetland from excessive soil erosion, rapid water runoff, and drying vegetation.<br>
The Ackerson Meadow Restoration Project is the largest wetland restoration project in Yosemite’s history and has the stats to prove it!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">🌱 More than 150,000 cubic yards of soil and mixed woodchips were placed to completely fill the large erosion gully.<br>
🌱 90 pounds of seeds were sown from 23 native species.<br>
🌱 2 acres of salvaged willows were planted.<br>
🌱 128,785 wetland container plants were planted on the restored meadow surface.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In 2025, staff will return to complete the project by planting 297,000 additional container plants on the newly restored channel surface.</p>

<p>There are just a few days left to apply for the North Pines Campground early access lottery for 2025. Like the past few years, reservations for North Pines will be released by one-time early access lottery for the 2025 season (April 22 through October 5). The lottery application period will be open through December 14, 2024 (9 pm PST) on Recreation.gov. Successful lottery applicants will have an opportunity to make a reservation for campsites in North Pines Campground during a less-competitive early access period. Any remaining availability will be released on the usual on-sale dates (five months in advance on the 15th of the month) beginning February 15.</p>

<p>Did you know Yosemite National Park houses over four million pieces in the archives? Archives are records which create documentary evidence of the past. They are facts which are used to interpret and understand history and are essential in telling the story of a place or organization. If you took all the collections and stacked them in one pile, it would reach above the great face of El Capitan. That’s a lot of history!</p>
<p>Recently, Yosemite hosted the National Park Archives Practicum, where staff from sites across the country gathered to learn about proper archive procedures and care. Participants learned how to determine what records have value to their parks, and how to properly protect and store them for hundreds of years to come. They also participated in hands-on experience with processing collections and brainstormed with peers on best practices for fair and safe public access to each park’s archives.</p>
<p>Are you interested in learning more about the archives in Yosemite? Over 6,500 images are available anytime through our Digital Archives, or you can visit the Yosemite Archives at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/archives.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/archives.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/archives.htm</a> to learn more about our collections</p>

<p>Choose your villain: trout bully or a really bad skin infection.</p>
<p>No really, Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs could not catch a break in the past century! Between nonnative trout acting as unrelenting, indiscriminate predators and the spread of the virulent chytrid fungus, their numbers were dwindling.  At one time the rare Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (Rana sierrae) was the most abundant amphibian in the high mountain lakes of the Sierra Nevada. Populations have since declined approximately 95% in the Sierra Nevada, including in Yosemite.  Because of this decline they have been listed as an endangered species under the Federal Endangered Species Act. </p>
<p>Some inspired biologists acted on a groundbreaking method and reintroduced small but mighty (chytrid fungus resistant) Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs into vacant habitats, hoping that encouraging these hardy populations would pay off.  After more than 15 years of studies, we are now cautiously optimistic that these chytrid fungus resistant frogs have a chance on not only surviving, but potentially ✨thriving✨</p>

<p>Yosemite National Park will require day-use entrance reservations for the last three weekends of February 2025 to manage the Horsetail Fall event.</p>
<p>During February, thousands of visitors visit Horsetail Fall, a waterfall that can glow orange when it's backlit by sunset, which can make it appear to be on fire. This unique lighting effect happens only on evenings with a clear sky when the waterfall is flowing and when the sun is at the right angle in mid– to late February. This event attracts many visitors to a small area, causing traffic congestion, parking issues, safety concerns, and impacts to natural and cultural resources.<b> </b><strong>To manage this event, a reservation will be required to enter Yosemite National Park on the weekends of February 8–9, February 15–17, and February 22–23, 2025</strong>, even for those not visiting Horsetail Fall<strong>. </strong>Visitors who arrive Mondays through Fridays (except Monday, February 17) won't need a reservation. The $35/car entrance fee is valid for entry for seven days, regardless of day of arrival. A similar system has been implemented for this event the past several years.</p>
<p>Beginning at 8 am Pacific time on November 18, 50% of day-use reservations will be available for all three weekends at <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recreation.gov%2Ftimed-entry%2F10086745%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0_kLrICu7kPVFbUv_qoaSJwNPu0qkCrRtF3YyfqeJO4_xcma14RRs6sOg_aem_8ibTKcljnskZp1-AG3gwRw&amp;h=AT2s6pSaAS4JtpCDQ3uH-LsuRYIQ4h-sPo2f5EDL_lc93Munfxs3vOlMvaXIoYtFtIE-8bweWVCqAeG50JncxIPlPRxYuhn7wq0iqzck-dxZb48cB2f5DAU-xbBeC8Ieag&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c%5b0%5d=AT3HUImLDT1gSOR2kCMW-XPUCQDsnRqQuGWy7seZlIf9Edr-vZcYmJg7yFL70iJqv0eqkG5JF_DaZg6gZoTtxZdUyUYiqCjyCyu_SWht_7iSXP4TWQqRfP8-0HhGG3JBlqZlS3C0yORdVPVLXre1trhfZROq2JAev1qSKoiQ8sGujMPbIVZl6QbuFfD60Fv7TUOE78FTpG-RYg3JOBChn1sCDw" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#myModal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-remote="/common/commonspot/customcf/modals/modal_intercept.cfm?targetURL=https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.recreation.gov%252Ftimed-entry%252F10086745%253Ffbclid%253DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0_kLrICu7kPVFbUv_qoaSJwNPu0qkCrRtF3YyfqeJO4_xcma14RRs6sOg_aem_8ibTKcljnskZp1-AG3gwRw%26h%3DAT2s6pSaAS4JtpCDQ3uH-LsuRYIQ4h-sPo2f5EDL_lc93Munfxs3vOlMvaXIoYtFtIE-8bweWVCqAeG50JncxIPlPRxYuhn7wq0iqzck-dxZb48cB2f5DAU-xbBeC8Ieag%26__tn__%3D-UK-R%26c%255b0%255d%3DAT3HUImLDT1gSOR2kCMW-XPUCQDsnRqQuGWy7seZlIf9Edr-vZcYmJg7yFL70iJqv0eqkG5JF_DaZg6gZoTtxZdUyUYiqCjyCyu_SWht_7iSXP4TWQqRfP8-0HhGG3JBlqZlS3C0yORdVPVLXre1trhfZROq2JAev1qSKoiQ8sGujMPbIVZl6QbuFfD60Fv7TUOE78FTpG-RYg3JOBChn1sCDw">https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745</a>.

For example, on February 21 at 8 am, day-use reservations for February 23 will be available.</p>
<p>If you have a lodging reservation for Yosemite Valley, Wawona, Foresta, or Yosemite West, you don’t need an additional entrance reservation. Campground reservations will be required for Camp 4, Hodgdon Meadow, and Wawona Campgrounds from February 8 through February 23, 2025 (these campgrounds normally operate on a first-come, first-served basis in February). Campground reservations will be released on December 15 at 7 am PST on recreation.gov. If you have a reservation for a campground inside the park, you don’t need an additional entrance reservation.</p>

<p>Our condolences to the family and friends of Yosemite Search and Rescue "SAR siter" Chris Gay, who died recently in an off-duty accident.<br>
(Post credit to @foyosar)</p>
<p>Obituary for Chris Gay YOSAR/TSAR team member. We wish you well on your next journey Chris; Rest in Valinor.</p>
<p>Bilbo beside the fire: JRR Tolkien Bk 2 Ch 3<br>
I sit beside the fire and think<br>
of all that I have seen,<br>
of meadow-flowers and butterflies<br>
in summers that have been;</p>
<p>Of yellow leaves and gossamer<br>
in autumns that there were,<br>
with morning mist and silver sun<br>
and wind upon my hair.</p>
<p>I sit beside the fire and think<br>
of how the world will be<br>
when winter comes without a spring<br>
that I shall ever see.</p>
<p>For still there are so many things<br>
that I have never seen:<br>
in every wood in every spring<br>
there is a different green.</p>
<p>I sit beside the fire and think<br>
of people long ago,<br>
and people who will see a world<br>
that I shall never know.</p>
<p>But all the while I sit and think<br>
of times there were before,<br>
I listen for returning feet<br>
and voices at the door.</p>

<p>Yosemite’s Visitor Access Management Plan and Environmental Assessment (EA) is now open for comment. We are seeking your input on this plan to improve visitors’ access to and experience in the park during its peak season. The public comment period ends September 30. This comment period is the third and final opportunity to provide input on the plan. </p>
<p>The plan includes three approaches, called alternatives, for proactively managing visitor access to help meet long-term resource protection, visitor experience, and park operational management goals. The park’s preferred alternative is to implement a parkwide daily reservation system during peak hours.    </p>
<p>The plan was prepared to provide analysis and an opportunity for public comment to support informed decision-making. The draft plan and environmental assessment, as well as other plan information, are available on the NPS Planning, Environment and Public Comment (PEPC) website at <a href="https://parkplanning.nps.gov/YosemiteVisitorAccess">parkplanning.nps.gov/YosemiteVisitorAccess</a>. Click “Open for Comment” to submit a response.</p>
<p>A virtual public meeting will be held on Thursday, August 22 at 4 pm PDT and additional public meetings will be held in gateway communities the week of September 9. National Park Service staff will be on-hand to answer questions and share information. For more information, click on “Meeting Notices” in the project website.  </p>
<p>During the first two rounds of public engagement for this plan during the winter of 2022/2023 and summer 2023, the park received around 6,000 letters. The comments helped inform the development of management concepts, refine issue statements, strategies, and concepts under consideration. </p>
<p>From 2014 to 2019, the park piloted different management strategies including restricting access to East Yosemite Valley when parking lots reached capacity and actively managing parking at other popular locations. From 2020 to 2022 and again in 2024, the park piloted day-use reservation systems for the entire park. Data gathered during these periods helped inform a range of alternatives to alleviate the chronic congestion that has affected Yosemite for more than 50 years and to provide quality visitor access in the future. </p>

<p>In the middle of lodgepole forest and huge slabs of granite, lies Tenaya Lake. This alpine lake spans about a mile long, and its bright blue water beckons passerby to breach the sandy beaches and dip their toes in.</p>
<p>The water is as still as glass, except for ripples cast by swimmers or paddleboarders, so it is easy to see the aberrations that protrude from the east side of the lake.</p>
<p>Are they tree stumps? Logs? Growing from the depths of the lake? It's a mystery, for sure. In this video, we (literally) dive deep with park geologist Greg Stock, into how these trees came to be, and find out what they tell us about Yosemite's past, present, and future. An audio described version is available at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=27EB9CA5-2697-4CD8-AFD8-2F93B750A2C7" id="https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=27EB9CA5-2697-4CD8-AFD8-2F93B750A2C7|">https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=27EB9CA5-2697-4CD8-AFD8-2F93B750A2C7</a></p>

<p>Schools might be starting back after summer break, but the opportunity to learn outdoors is year-round. WildLink is a partnership between the National Park Service and NatureBridge. It aims to expand access and opportunity in our public lands by facilitating wilderness exploration for students from communities with historic and systemic barriers to outdoor access.</p>
<p> Through wilderness expeditions, volunteer stewardship projects, leadership training, family weekends, and career development opportunities, WildLink empowers young people to strengthen themselves and their communities. WildLink trips provide many students with their first outdoor experiences. For students from New Village Girls Academy, it was their first time seeing snow. These outdoor experiences foster a sense of belonging and help students understand that public lands are open to everyone. Students from Monache High School were welcomed by Ranger Shelton Johnson, who invited them to see Yosemite as a place where they belonged. During these trips, students engaged in activities such as mycology, geology, biology, and art, demonstrating that learning extends beyond the classroom walls.</p>
<p>To read more about these spring trips, you can check out the WildLink Blogs, at <a href="https://naturebridge.org/wildlink" id="https://naturebridge.org/wildlink|" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#myModal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-remote="/common/commonspot/customcf/modals/modal_intercept.cfm?targetURL=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturebridge.org%2Fwildlink">https://naturebridge.org/wildlink</a>. WildLink is free to students, removing the financial barrier outdoor experiences can have. Thank you @yosemiteconservancy donors and @naturebridge for your support of this program.</p>

Have you ever hiked in Yosemite and stumbled upon a remnant of human history? So far, only 12% of the park's nearly 1200 square miles have been surveyed, leaving many stories yet to be uncovered.
<p>In Yosemite, there are around 2,500 documented archeological sites, including ancient milling features and old homesteads, that date as far back as 10,000 years and as recent as 50 years old. Archeologists like Alex Kuzmin and Isobel Coats have a key role in protecting these sites and analyzing their historical significance. In the field, they survey landscapes to identify and document human impacts, ensuring that sites are protected during park projects. They also methodically excavate buried materials, study artifacts, and conduct research to map trade routes.</p>
<p>Archeologists systematically survey for artifacts, features, ecofacts, sites, districts, and landscapes. In Yosemite, the most abundant artifact from the precontact period is obsidian, which provides valuable insights into the deep cultural history of the area. Obsidian is a type of volcanic glass formed from rapidly cooled lava. Obsidian found in the park likely originates from sources on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, representing the extensive trade networks used by Indigenous people throughout this region. Obsidian can be sharpened to a fine edge, making it a great material for crafting sharp and durable tools, including projectile points for hunting, blades for cutting, scrapers for processing hides, and awls for piercing.</p>
<p>Diagnostic projectile points provide valuable information to archeologists about source material, artifact age, cultural links, and technological development. Analyzing these tools reveals trade routes, cultural affiliations, and changes in tool-making over time. Context is key in archeology, and if artifacts are removed from their original location, this context is lost. If you are fortunate enough to make an archeological discovery in Yosemite, you can help preserve our shared heritage by leaving artifacts where you find them.</p>

<p>How does it feel to stand underneath giant sequoias?</p>
<p>The enormous stature and prowess of giant sequoias are almost incomprehensible. Towering above more abundant trees like pines and incense cedars, sequoias inspire prose, profound emotions, and a call for protection. The genesis of national parks as a concept owes much to the intrinsic values of sequoias and the sense of wonder they evoke.</p>
<p>In fact, on this very day in 1864, an act creating the Yosemite Grant was signed, federally protecting Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias while transferring them to state management; the first time in U.S. history that land was designated for public use and preservation for its scenic value.</p>
<p>This June marks seven years since the Mariposa Grove was reopened in 2018 after a three-year restoration closure. The closure allowed for the largest ecological restoration project in the park's history, improving conditions for the giant sequoias and creating a more enjoyable visitor experience.</p>
<p>Balancing human access to nature with the protection of sites and species is a delicate task, and we celebrate this restoration project for fulfilling both of these needs.</p>
<p>Thanks to Yosemite Conservancy donors for their generous support; this project would not have been possible without them.</p>

<p>Did you know that with each step you take through Yosemite, you can make a positive impact on land, vegetation, and waterways?</p>
<p>The second principle in Leave No Trace ethics is to travel and camp on durable surfaces. By doing so, you reduce soil compaction, erosion, and trampling of vegetation, therefore protecting essential habitats for plants, animals, and fungi.</p>
<p>How do I know if I'm on a durable surface?</p>
<p>When hiking, follow maps and signs to stay on established trails. If you travel through designated wilderness or an area without trails, stick to rocks, sand, gravel, and dry grasses. These surfaces are less likely to be permanently impacted by your movement. When camping, choose an established spot— good campsites are found, not made.</p>
<p>By taking intentional strides, you are helping keep our unique habitats healthy and hospitable to the array of life they support.</p>

<p>It takes a lot to open Tioga Road; an adventure to unearth the pass from a season of snow is made ever more challenging with the dynamic conditions that spring brings.<br>
Despite the storm last weekend, which deposited 20-24 inches of new snow to work through, crews are making great progress. Methods like charcoal blasting help expedite snow removal and decrease avalanche risk for crews and visitors alike. As of Sunday, the road has been plowed up to Olmsted Point, about 30 miles from Crane Flat gate.</p>
<p>As dozers and blowers work beyond Olmsted, this zone will remain under monitoring for avalanche risk, as warmer temperatures creep up on us. New snow has mostly melted out, but there is still a lot of removal to be done.</p>
<p>We are just as stoked to regain access to the high country as you, and want to iterate that slow and steady is the only way to win this race. An audio-described version of this video is available at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=249E3993-2E70-441B-8406-D6547FBDAA93" id="https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=249E3993-2E70-441B-8406-D6547FBDAA93|">https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=249E3993-2E70-441B-8406-D6547FBDAA93</a></p>

Spring delivers an annual reminder that the certainty of death is paralleled by the certainty of life. </p>

<p back="" blanket="" cradling="" hibernation="" is="" of="" peeled="" the="" yosemite="">The<b> </b>blanket of hibernation cradling Yosemite is peeled back, revealing cautious purveyors making their first foray onto hydrated soils. Sarcodes sanguinea, commonly known as snow plant, heeds not in making itself known. Its bright red inflorescence propels through wintered duff like a phoenix rising from the ashes, announcing the arrival of a new season. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Derived from the Latin sanguine, 'sanguniea' describes the blood-red coloration of snow plants. Lacking chlorophyll, the snow plant is unable to photosynthesize like other plants. Making no apologies, it gains nutrients by tapping into the mycorrhizal fungi attached to the root systems of nearby conifers. </p>

Did you know that Yosemite has multiple historic apple orchards? Well, our bears and volunteers do! Although apple trees are not native to the Sierra Nevada, they remain in the park because of their significant human history. Settlers in the nineteenth century planted orchards in Yosemite Valley to grow food for both humans and livestock. Among the most famous of these orchards is Curry Orchard, located in the Curry Village parking lot. When the apples on these hundred-year-old trees become ripe enough to eat in the late summer, the bears would have no issue helping themselves. Such an arrangement, though, could lead to human-bear conflict in such a high traffic area. To prevent this, volunteers join us each year for an apple picking day in Curry Orchard. Last year, our volunteers picked approximately 1.5 tons of apples! Some quick math puts that at about 15,000 apples! It’s a day of hard work but an honorable task that protects our wildlife (and visitor property) and enables the preservation of these historic trees. As part of #NationalParkWeek, we’d like to thank our many volunteers for their contributions to the joy that is Yosemite! Some staff our campgrounds as camp hosts, some drop in for annual park cleanup projects, others tackle various resource management projects, and so much more. If you’re curious to join them—for Apple Picking Day or anything else—please click the link below for more information and to contact our volunteer office. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/getinvolved/volunteer.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/getinvolved/volunteer.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/getinvolved/volunteer.htm</a></p>

It’s that time of year, when our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers migrate south for the summer (unlike most snowbirds). As Rob and Laura prepare for the final snow survey of the season, they are enjoying the springlike weather and good ski conditions. With a late start to winter and early spring storms, there is an ample snowpack that will be going through melt freeze cycles producing decent conditions for skiing; but visitors will need to mindful of avalanche concerns as they will become an increasing hazard as overnight temperatures increase. Check out their last post of the season and learn more about conditions and the plethora of animals returning to the high county: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-17-2024.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-17-2024.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-17-2024.htm</a>.</p>

“This isn’t even my final form!” – Yosemite Falls in April, just about every year.</p>
<p>Yosemite Falls has been making quite a splash lately in a display that should only be getting bigger over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>While recent rains add an extra surge to the flow, it’s primarily snow that feeds our most famous waterfall—snow that is properly melting right about now. The aptly named Yosemite Creek at the top of the fall collects the snowmelt from 43 square miles north of the Valley, but that melt doesn’t occur all at once. Warming temperatures ramp up the melt rate of the snow that’s been stockpiling since the fall, with peak flow usually occurring sometime in May before often drying out completely in late summer. For this reason, our hydrologists measure the flow of the park’s waterways in a “water year” that turns over each October that captures one continuous cycle of snowfall, melt, and dry season.</p>
<p>At the link below, you can learn more about park hydrology and can even check out live flow data from our various river gages. If you think this waterfall is impressive, just wait to see it in the next month or so when the Merced River will likely be flowing at over 2000… cubic feet per second, that is.</p>

Our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers are approaching the end of their season, and it is starting to feel like spring in the high country as the sound of running water in the creeks and streams grows louder. That said, they still saw 18 inches of new snow last week! This resulted in some nice powder conditions on some slopes above 9,000 feet. It’s quite a mix of conditions up there, as you’d expect. With rapid changes during this weather transition (from unseasonably cold to much warmer), there’s bound to be some unstable snow conditions and wilderness users need to be mindful of the April sun on all aspects during their trips.

March ended with snowy weather, bringing 24 inches of new snow to Tuolumne Meadows last week. Sunny warm days quickly followed, and our winter rangers enjoyed some spring bluebird powder days before the next storm rolled in (today!). It’s a good time of year to be prepared for varying snow conditions if venturing into the wilderness, some of which may require ice axe and crampons in the alpine zones.

Along the western route into the park, the scenery slowly builds until one arrives at the shocking severity of Yosemite Valley. Although that first glimpse of Half Dome or El Capitan may appear as a sudden development over the rest of the terrain, the forces that produced such wonders are visible along the approach, and not always in miniature.</p>
<p>About three miles west of Yosemite Valley along El Portal Road in the Merced River gorge stands the Cookie Cliff. Composed of the same rock as El Capitan, the cliff draws attention from rock climbers but is largely ignored by other visitors intent on Yosemite Valley. What’s impossible to miss, though, are these massive boulders on the side of the road. These boulders tumbled from the cliff over forty years ago today on April 3, 1982, in a rockslide that moved nearly 143,000 tons of rock that covered about 500 feet of the road (luckily, no one was on the road at that time).</p>
<p>Rockfalls have long shaped Yosemite since the retreating glaciers exposed the cliffs about 16,000 years ago. A historical survey from 1857 to 2023 documented 1,642 rockfalls, rockslides, and similar events, each cutting or shaping a particular facet of a Yosemite cliffside, famous or otherwise. Despite its comparative anonymity, the Cookie Cliff made a bold statement in 1982 with one of the largest historical rockslides.</p>
<p>The cliffs of Yosemite Valley draw far more attention than those in the canyons of the western approach, but with a bit more attention, the forces of Yosemite can be seen setting the stage all along the way. </p>

<p>This year’s Shakespeare in Yosemite production, A Midsummer Yosemite’s Dream, will be performed in the Curry Village Amphitheater on Friday, April 26 (5 pm), Saturday, April 27 (noon and 5 pm), and April 28 (5 pm). Inspired by a discovery in the Yosemite Archives of an unproduced 1934 production of a Midsummer Night’s Dream in front of Yosemite Falls, this new take on Shakespeare’s magical comedy will feature lots of music, dancing park rangers, and environmental stories that take characters back in time to 1934. Filled with humor and heart, this musical adaptation imagines a collision of 1930s fairies with 2024 Ranger Mechanicals and lover-tourists. The cast includes UC Merced students, faculty, and alumni as well as National Park Service and Yosemite Hospitality employees, both behind the scenes and on stage. Shows are 90 minutes long. Learn more: <a href="YosemiteShakes.ucmerced.edu" id="YosemiteShakes.ucmerced.edu|">YosemiteShakes.ucmerced.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Shakespeare in Yosemite was founded in 2017 to bring short, accessible, and FREE productions of Shakespeare’s plays to Yosemite National Park for Earth Day and Shakespeare’s birthday each April.</p>
<p>Note that a reservation is required on April 27 and April 28 during peak hours (5 am – 4 pm) if you are staying outside of the park and entering in your own vehicle: <a href="/yose/planyourvisit/reservations.htm" id="CP___PAGEID=6492117,reservations.htm,550|">go.nps.gov/reserve</a>.</p>

If it was snowing down here in Yosemite Valley, it was snowing up in Tuolumne Meadows for our winter rangers, too! Laura and Rob report twenty inches of new snow in the high country this past week along with sightings of a red-winged blackbird, some violet-green swallows, and an osprey… Seems like the season can’t make up its mind about spring, but if you decide to head up to the high country this week, be sure to check out their latest blog update for more on snowpack conditions and avalanche risk in addition to their continued investigations into the history of snow surveys.</p>

The high country is looking alive as of late: a soaring golden eagle and skipping white-tailed jackrabbit, strong winds from the northeast and a widening river from warmer temperatures. Motion abounds for our winter rangers in Tuolumne Meadows. These conditions, though, partial to wet loose or slab avalanches, may be quickly replaced by the forecast cold and precipitation this weekend.</p>

Chiura Obata (1885-1975) found “Great Nature” in Yosemite on a formative trip to the park in 1927. In paint and ink, he expressed his intimate appreciation for the landscape over a successful art career that celebrated numerous exhibitions, excelled in a faculty position at the University of California, Berkeley, and persisted through the upheaval of his forced removal into incarceration centers during WWII.</p>
<p>This summer, we will continue to honor his legacy with the return of our annual Obata Art Weekend, August 30 through September 1. While exact programming schedules are still to be determined, be sure to acquire a reservation now on <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745" id="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745|">Recreation.gov</a> if you would like to attend the bulk of the event on Saturday, August 31.</p>
<p>To learn more about Obata, we are excited to offer this short documentary “Obata’s Yosemite,” made possible by the generosity of Yosemite Conservancy and its donors. In the short film, we join Japanese American Yosemite National Park Ranger April Kunieda and others on a tour of the painter’s life, work, and love for the wonder and joy that “Great Nature” has to offer to us all.</p>

Our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers were greeted with 47 inches of new snow last week at the start of March during the late season storm that brought blizzard conditions. Along with the snow, came the highest sustained winds Rob and Laura had observed in their 13 years here as winter rangers. While you might expect all the fresh snow to leave behind a blanketed landscape, the extreme winds blew snow in all different directions creating a variety of ski and avalanche conditions.

Before this latest storm rolled in, our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers Rob and Laura spent the week out on the thirteen inches of fresh powder performing snow surveys. (Don’t worry, they made it back to shelter in Tuolumne Meadows in time.) While we all await to see exactly what this massive weather event has in store, click the link below to check out their latest blog update from Wednesday with more details on the maps, mechanics, and math of taking snow surveys, details on avalanche conditions, as well as recent high-country wildlife sightings, including a northern pygmy owl (Glaucidium gnoma) and a pine marten (Martes americana) this week.</p>

Last week was a hoot up in Tuolumne Meadows! Great horned owls were heard bantering at dawn and dusk, and the rapid-fire calls of a northern pygmy owl competed to be heard. In addition to numerous bird sightings, our high-country winter rangers measured 29 inches of new snow in the past week and experienced a lot of high winds. The settled snow depth is now at 50 inches in Tuolumne Meadows, which is decent considering how dry November and December were. There is still the potential for persistent slab avalanches, so winter recreationalists need to be aware.

“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.” – Margaret Mead</p>
<p>Last year, 4,546 exceptional volunteers donated 95,065 service hours to Yosemite. Some project accomplishments by our volunteer groups include picking over 1.5 tons of apples to prevent human/bear encounters, collecting 11,612 buckets of trash, planting 4,756 plants, and repairing and installing over 700 fence posts and rails along trails.</p>
<p>Yosemite's volunteers are dedicated, hardworking, and essential to our park operations.</p>
<p>If you are interested in volunteering as a group, the 2024 Volunteer Project Catalog is live on the park website: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/getinvolved/supportyourpark/groupvolunteer.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/getinvolved/supportyourpark/groupvolunteer.htm|">www.nps.gov/yose/getinvolved/supportyourpark/groupvolunteer.htm</a></p>
<p>Applications are due by Sunday, February 25th at 11:59 pm Pacific time. Only groups within California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona will be considered as an effort to reduce the park's overall carbon footprint. If you have any questions, please email yose_volunteers@nps.gov</p>

Snow showers last week left the park high country with snow depths a bit below average for the time of year but effective for skiing, nonetheless. While the enjoying the powder themselves, our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers spotted a flock of sandhill cranes (Antigone canadensis) passing overhead, honking their rattling call.</p>
<p>If you look to do a bit of migration yourself up to the high country this week, do be careful with terrain selection, as recent strong winds left behind wind and persistent slabs prone to avalanches, and the storm this coming weekend looks to bring much more snow.</p>

Our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers have been experiencing mixed messages in the high country this winter. The end of January saw record warm temperatures, and the start of February brought two atmospheric rivers that brought welcome new snow to the Sierra Nevada and over 100+ mph winds at several locations. The most recent storm resulted in an “upside down” snowpack in that the storm started cold and got warmer as it progressed. This means that colder and drier snow now has warmer and wetter snow on top of it. Not an ideal recipe for stellar ski conditions, but the much-improved coverage and deeper snowpack is a worthwhile trade off.

With only one new inch of snow this past week in the high country, our winter Tuolumne Meadows rangers don’t have too much to report this week besides the terrain’s usual scenic beauty. Instead, let’s look at how we measure the snowpack at our snow survey stations. It’s a simple process, but simple doesn’t always mean easy!</p>
<p>To measure the snowpack, our snow surveyors plunge a Mount Rose snow sampler, effectively a long metal tube marked in regular increments of distance, through the snow until it reaches the ground proper. The tube is toothed on the business end to help it cut through ice layers, but even then, it can take a lot of elbow grease to break through multiple frozen layers, clear clogs, etc. all with the hope of finally hearing it scrape on granite or come back up with dirt and pine duff at the end. In some high snow years, like last year, it can be hours to sample one site. With only twenty inches of accumulated snow right now, it’s not as difficult at present. We’ll see if the storm arriving tonight changes things. </p>

Did you know that when Horsetail Fall lights up like fire during the sunset in February, the effect is only visible from a certain angle? On #NationalPlanForVacationDay today, make sure you take this into account if you’re looking to visit our park next month for the Horsetail Fall event (along with getting your entrance reservation for visiting on most weekends and the holiday!)</p>
<p>Although you certainly get a nice view of El Capitan and the fall from the west, the famous effect only occurs if you watch from a more easternly vantage, such as in El Capitan Picnic Area. The decision of where to go is quite easy these days as a set of road and trail closures during the event will funnel you into some of these prime viewing locations (and away from more sensitive ecological features like riverbanks.) However, to see the effect, you’re going to need to park and grab a spot in the designated areas alongside everyone else.</p>
<p>So, get your reservation on Recreation.gov two days in advance of your trip if you’re visiting on the last three weekends or holiday this February, and ultimately plan to arrive no later than mid-morning for the sunset. Even though Horsetail Fall may be visible near Bridalveil Fall, there’s no “firefall” to see for those stuck in traffic west of El Capitan.</p>

The weather in Tuolumne Meadows the past week was characterized by warmer temperatures and 18 inches of new snow. Although coverage is good, our high-country winter rangers still consider it to be “early season conditions” so visitors should continue to use caution and be wary of obstacles just beneath the snow surface. Skiers and wildlife took advantage of the conditions recently and Rob and Laura were able to enjoy the overhead company of a bald eagle and other wildlife before they departed for the upcoming snow surveys.

Have you visited the new Welcome Center in Yosemite Valley? With its towering ceilings and open window walls, this space is a classic example of Yosemite's mid-century architecture. While renovations were completed last year, the building itself was constructed in 1959 as part of Mission 66, a major effort to revitalize the parks after World War II.</p>
<p>The Village Store complex, also called at times the "merchandise center," has served many purposes over its more than sixty years of history. The modern-day Welcome Center originally housed a restaurant, shown in these photos taken around 1960. In the 1970s, the space was transformed into the Sport Shop, which sold outdoor gear until it closed in 2016. After a period of vacancy, the Welcome Center opened its doors in November 2023.</p>
<p>To learn more about the history of this building, as well as other Mission 66 projects, visit: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/mission-66.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/mission-66.htm|">www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/mission-66.htm</a></p>

The results are in! The park’s 2023 Christmas Bird Count proved a successful and joyous time as always for our many participants spread out across multiple regions inside and just outside the park. To no one’s surprise, the American robin (Turdus migratorius) was the most spotted bird this year, followed by the ruby-crowned kinglet (Corthylio calendula) and acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus). Unprecedented sightings for our local Christmas Bird Count data this year included a wood duck (Aix sponsa) in the Merced River Canyon near El Portal and a spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularius) in Yosemite Valley near El Capitan Meadow. Though seen at least once most years, a golden eagle (Aquila chyrsaetos) refused to be outdone and made a perfect entrance through the parting clouds.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1932 in the park, the Yosemite Christmas Bird Count event is approaching its one-hundredth consecutive year. We’d like to thank our volunteers for keeping this tradition going one year more.</p>

This week’s update from our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers speaks to the distinctive conditions found so far this season. Conditions are more indicative of a continental climate (which is characterized by cold and dry winter weather) compared to the typically warm and wet weather we see in the Sierra Nevada (making it more of a maritime climate). Don’t let this week’s 19 inches of new snow in Tuolumne Meadows fool you into thinking that it was “wet,” as Rob and Laura only measured 0.97 inches of snow water equivalent (SWE) in nineteen inches of snow. The frequency of modest and cold storms so far this winter has resulted in an atypical Sierra Nevada snowpack. These unique conditions make for avalanche hazards, so be prepared if you are venturing into the high elevation wilderness areas.

Parkitecture (that’s “park architecture” for short!) isn't just log cabins and shingle siding, that familiar look of heavy timber and stone structures known as the rustic style. Many historic buildings in the parks, including in Yosemite, are mid-century modern designs. After World War II, the National Park Service shifted away from the classic rustic style and their increasing construction costs to a more modern aesthetic. This move coincided with Mission 66, a ten-year project from 1956 to 1966 for which Congress and President Eisenhower approved $1 billion of spending to modernize infrastructure and address a long backlog of maintenance across the National Park System.</p>
<p>Like rustic designs, mid-century park architects were inspired by the idea of buildings harmonizing with the landscape, but unlike the ornate details of that previous style, Mission 66 architecture emphasizes simplicity and open circulation patterns, blending into the environment in a more utilitarian, understated fashion. Mission 66 designs in Yosemite impart a mountain chalet aesthetic mixed with mid-century construction methods of prefabricated elements with plenty of steel framing and glass. Woodsy log details, peaked window walls, and simple A-frame shapes characterize Yosemite's Mission 66-era buildings, including the Yosemite Valley Lodge, Welcome Center, and Degnan's Kitchen.</p>

This week saw the welcome return of winter weather to the Sierra Nevada, and in Tuolumne Meadows two storms brought twenty-one inches of low-density snow and frigid temperatures that were below zero on most mornings. Snow coverage has vastly improved, and the High Sierra is looking resplendent in its winter coat of white.

A few minor weather disturbances came through the Sierra Nevada last week and left a skiff of new snow and colder temperatures in their wake at the highest elevation areas of the park, with 11 new inches recorded in Tuolumne Meadows. The snowpack remains well below average for this time of year, but more is in the forecast. In this week’s blog entry from our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers, learn about the history of snow surveying and the Sierra Nevada legend Dr. James Church Jr. who established a series of snow courses near Lake Tahoe in 1908 and whose methods bore today’s snow surveying techniques: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-3-2024.htm">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-3-2024.htm</a>.</p>

After another dry week with average temperatures, snow coverage in the high country is adequate in some places, but according to our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers, it is still a toss-up as to whether it is ski season or hiking season in this part of the Sierra Nevada. With snow in the forecast for the weekend, conditions may change soon. Learn more about ski and avalanche conditions and wildlife sightings in this week’s update: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-27-2023.htm">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-27-2023.htm</a>.</p>

‘Tis the season for our beloved Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers to make their pilgrimage to their winter home in the high country. On December 8, they were able to ski into Tuolumne Meadows on a mere one to six inches of snow. Although it has been a dry start to the season and snow depths presently range from bare ground to twelve inches, this week a warm storm brought rain and high elevation snow to the central Sierra Nevada. Laura and Rob are hoping for snow to start piling up as they prepare for their winter patrols! Check out their first update of the season, with weekly posts to come: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-20-2023.htm">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-20-2023.htm</a>.</p>

We are announcing a pilot “Peak Hours Plus” 2024 vehicle reservation system for park entry on some days between April 13 and October 27, 2024, for those driving into or through Yosemite National Park between 5 am and 4 pm. Reservations will be required as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>April 13 through June 30: A reservation is required from 5 am to 4 pm on Saturdays, Sundays, and on holidays (May 27 and June 19).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>July 1 through August 16: A reservation is required from 5 am to 4 pm daily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>August 17 through October 27: A reservation is required from 5 am to 4 pm on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays (September 2 and October 14).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Visitors will pick from two types of reservations: Reservations valid for a full day (5 am to 4 pm), or reservations valid for park entry any time after 12 pm. Both reservation types (full day and afternoon entry) are valid for up to three consecutive days, including the arrival date. Visitors with in-park lodging or campground reservations, wilderness or Half Dome permits, or visitors entering the park via YARTS buses and on permitted commercial tours do not need a vehicle reservation.</p>
<p>Reservations will be released beginning at 8 am (PST) on January 5, 2024, for all arrival dates (April 13 to October 27) at <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745" id="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745|">recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745</a>. Reservations will be available until they sell out. Afternoon entry reservations and additional full day reservations will be released one week in advance (e.g., reservations for a July 30 arrival date will be released on July 23). <a href="/yose/planyourvisit/reservations.htm" id="CP___PAGEID=6492117,reservations.htm,550|">Learn more.</a>.</p>
<p>Driving through the park will require a reservation if entering between 5 am and 4 pm. If you are planning to visit after peak hours, please do not arrive before 4 pm; vehicles blocking roads will be cited.</p>
<p>This temporary reservation system will help manage congestion and provide a quality visitor experience. This system will be similar to the 2022 “Peak Hours” system, with the addition of more reservations for afternoon entries. We are experimenting with a few different ideas for this summer as we work on the <a href="/yose/getinvolved/visitoraccessmanagement.htm" id="CP___PAGEID=7400795,visitoraccessmanagement.htm,3822|">Visitor Access Management Plan</a>.</p>

Captain Reynolds Hayden commanded the Navy Hospital in Pearl Harbor on this day in 1941 when the Imperial Japanese Navy executed their surprise attack. Twenty months later, he would find himself far across the Pacific, in Yosemite of all places, to run a new facility for the wounded sailors of the war that had followed that infamous day.</p>
<p>The US Navy leased The Ahwahnee Hotel from 1943 to 1945 as a “Special” naval hospital, an arrangement made possible by the nation’s need for expanded medical facilities timed with a substantial drop in tourism. For many patients, though, the looming stone Valley walls proved to be isolating more than inspiring. So, Captain Reynolds Hayden worked hard with the local community to expand recreational facilities for patients and had converted the hotel into a successful, holistic treatment center by end of its commission.</p>
<p>Wars demand much from the community that suffers them, a cost worth remembering as both an homage to the past and a lesson for the future. However, as Cpt. Hayden demonstrated in Yosemite, it also takes a community to heal those wounds. Although far from the violence of December 7, 1941, we are proud to be part of this great American context and what healing it could provide during the war, and as the community from that history continues to the present day, we look forward to what more healing our park can provide next.</p>

Following the success of the past two year's North Pines Campground early access lottery, we will be implementing this process for the full season of North Pines Campground this coming year (April 16 through the night of September 30, 2024). The lottery application period opened on November 28 and will remain open through December 12, 2023.</p>
<p>Successful lottery applicants will have an opportunity to make a reservation for campsites in North Pines Campground during a less-competitive early access period. Any remaining availability will be released on the usual on-sale dates (five months in advance on the 15th of the month) beginning February 15.</p>
<p>The goals of this lottery are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduce confusion and frustration for a highly competitive reservation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer a more equitable experience through a new method for reserving campsites at this high-demand location.</p>

Today, November 19, on Red Shawl Day we bring attention to the disproportionate violence faced by American Indians and Alaska Natives across the country. According to the Department of Justice, women of these demographics go missing and are murdered at a rate ten times greater than the national average. By commemorating the lives lost with the color red, we hope that a brighter spotlight on this tragedy may illuminate a path to greater justice, security, and closure for these victims and their communities.</p>

Yosemite National Park will require day-use entrance reservations for the last three weekends of February 2024 to manage the Horsetail Fall event.</p>
<p>During February, thousands of visitors visit Horsetail Fall, a waterfall that creates the illusion that the water is on fire. The surge in visitation has led to full parking lots, parking overflowing into traffic lanes, pedestrian-vehicle conflicts causing safety issues, and damage to natural and cultural resources. In order to manage this event, a reservation will be required to drive into Yosemite National Park on the weekends of February 10–11, February 17–19, and February 24–25, 2024. Visitors who arrive Mondays through Fridays (except Monday, February 19) won't need a reservation. The $35/car entrance fee is valid for entry for seven days, regardless of day of arrival. A similar system has been implemented for this event the past several years.</p>
<p>Beginning at 8 am Pacific time on December 1, 50% of day-use reservations will be available for all three weekends at <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745" id="https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745|">https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086745</a>. Beginning at 8 am Pacific time two days prior to a day-use reservation date, the remaining 50% of day-use reservations will be available. For example, on February 23 at 8 am, day-use reservations for February 25 will be available.</p>
<p>If you have a lodging reservation for Yosemite Valley, Wawona, Foresta, or Yosemite West, you don’t need an additional entrance reservation. </p>
<p>Campground reservations will be required for Camp 4, Hodgdon Meadow, and Wawona Campgrounds for Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays beginning February 9–February 25, 2024 (these campgrounds normally operate on a first-come, first-served basis in February). There will be a 2 night minimum reservation requirement. Reservations will be released on December 15 at 7 am Pacific time at <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/search?q=Yosemite%20National%20Park&amp;entity_id=2991&amp;entity_type=recarea&amp;inventory_type=camping&amp;inventory_type=rec%20areas&amp;parent_asset_id=2991" id="https://www.recreation.gov/search?q=Yosemite%20National%20Park&amp;entity_id=2991&amp;entity_type=recarea&amp;inventory_type=camping&amp;inventory_type=rec%20areas&amp;parent_asset_id=2991|">Recreation.gov.</a> If you have a campground reservation for Upper Pines, Camp 4, Hodgdon Meadow, or Wawona Campgrounds, you don’t need an additional entrance reservation. </p>

The Udall Foundation's Parks in Focus program has been partnering with the National Park Service and other organizations since 2010 to provide opportunities for San Francisco Bay Area youth to visit, explore, and photograph Yosemite National Park for the first time.</p>
<p>Led by talented Parks in Focus trip leaders, the annual program kicks off with local outings in the Bay Area and culminates in a four- or five-day camping trip to Yosemite. Throughout the trip, students meet with park rangers who help them discover the natural and cultural resources of the park, engage them in hands-on stewardship projects, and teach them about the importance of our national parks and public lands. Students explore their creativity and develop their photography skills while hiking and taking in stunning views of Yosemite Falls, Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, and other park sites. They compose incredible images that tell the stories of their adventures and showcase their unique perspectives on all of the things that inspire them along the way.</p>
<p>Photo highlights from our Yosemite program are featured annually at The Ansel Adams Gallery and have recently been exhibited at the Children’s Creativity Museum, the San Francisco International Airport Museum, and the Palo Alto Art Center.</p>
<p>Our annual Parks in Focus program at Yosemite is made possible by Yosemite Conservancy.</p>

The Yosemite Archives recently received a donation from Jack Burgess of a hand-rendered, ink-on linen drawing of the El Portal Railroad Station. The drawing, which is believed to have been completed in 1907 or early 1908, showcases the proposed design of the station, marking its different sections and elevations while also listing required construction materials.</p>
<p>G.H. Nickerson, the civil engineer for the Yosemite Valley Railroad (YVRR) completed the drawing, his signature displayed proudly below the title. The rail line was initially intended to transport lumber, but it quickly transformed into a passenger line too. While the station inspired by the drawing above did not officially open until 1908, a temporary structure in El Portal saw the first passengers arriving from Merced in 1907. The YVRR was revolutionary for its time, making the commute through the mountains to Yosemite National Park quicker and easier. Unfortunately, most of the YVRR tracks were scrapped in the mid-1940s, but an old YVRR caboose (#15) remains behind the El Portal Market.</p>
<p>The Yosemite Archives, located in El Portal, will be opening its doors and sharing more stories like this one, as well as showcasing collections and materials on Saturday, October 21st. Two 45-minute tours will be held, at 10 am and 1 pm. Both will be capped at 12 attendees and participants must reserve a spot by emailing yose_archives@nps.gov or calling 209-379-1283. Please RSVP by Monday, October 16. Please no animals (service animals permitted) and no guests under the age of 16.</p>

<p>Rangers in Yosemite do more than just look around the park. Sometimes (frequently, actually) we study it very closely, with intense scientific rigor. We track rockfalls and wildfires, while hydrology and air quality stations monitor river flow and air chemistry. We even model bird population distributions and document forest health and composition. Besides the simple fun of getting to know this landscape better, all of these pieces of data help inform our management policies.</p>
<p>And now you, too, can get an inside look at this data.</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce the Yosemite Observer Dashboard, a public website that collects physical science data about the park from many sources and presents it visually in one place. Curious to know the current wind speed at Ostrander Lake? You can find that on there. How about a plot of river flow at Happy Isles? Absolutely. Want a map of rockfalls in Yosemite Valley color-coded by the season of occurrence? Sure thing. There is even a 3D model you can fly around in to see locations of past rockfalls on the Yosemite Valley walls. And all this is before mentioning the fire maps and air chemistry sensors. We weren’t kidding about the bird population models, either.</p>

<p>Collaborate. Preserve. Protect.</p>
<p>These three principles drive Yosemite Facelift, an annual event that focuses on stewardship and preservation of the natural environment we love to recreate in. Started by Ken Yager, founder and president of the Yosemite Climbing Association, Facelift has a variety of events that are sure to keep you on your toes, including panel discussions and programs. Our national park is for everyone, and everyone can do their part in respecting these shared spaces, so register at <a href="https://www.yosemiteclimbing.org/yosemitefacelift2023?fbclid=IwAR3CqZB0n7Nt4rJNlkrydo-23Qhd93Y6KAtqM-e-dQZjLSEW9c5X4TwCF7Y" rel="nofollow" role="link" tabindex="0" target="_blank" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#myModal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-remote="/common/commonspot/customcf/modals/modal_intercept.cfm?targetURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yosemiteclimbing.org%2Fyosemitefacelift2023%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3CqZB0n7Nt4rJNlkrydo-23Qhd93Y6KAtqM-e-dQZjLSEW9c5X4TwCF7Y">https://www.yosemiteclimbing.org/yosemitefacelift2023</a> to join the fleet of volunteers that give Yosemite a makeover during this fun weekend.</p>
<p>When recreating in a natural space like Yosemite, there are a lot of unique factors to consider such as food storage and Leave No Trace principles. When picking up trash at Facelift, or occupying space here in general, it's important to be knowledgeable about and protect the natural and cultural resources that make this place what it is. This includes being aware of any closures in place to protect visitors and species like peregrine falcons, and respecting Yosemite's rich human history by admiring archeological artifacts and leaving them in place. </p>
<p>Yosemite National Park and climbing have a long and significant relationship. Thank you to the Yosemite Climbing Association, climbing stewards, climbing rangers, and our huge volunteer network for efforts like Facelift, that ensure this relationship is one of mutualism, that will continue to benefit climbers and the environment for generations to come.</p>

<p>Stanza and verse will ring throughout the meadows this weekend, during the 27th Annual Tuolumne Meadows Poetry Festival. Between August 19 and 20, there will be morning workshops and afternoon readings with music; featuring poets Marcelo Hernandez Castillo, Forrest Gander, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer, and musician Shira Kammen. This special event is made possible with the generous support of Yosemite Conservancy donors and will occur at Parsons Memorial Lodge; a grand finale to the Parsons Memorial Lodge Summer Speaker Series. The event schedule is available at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/event-details.htm?id=5CA8E469-A65E-2022-0F9F3CBC9D0BB4DB" id="https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/event-details.htm?id=5CA8E469-A65E-2022-0F9F3CBC9D0BB4DB|">https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/event-details.htm?id=5CA8E469-A65E-2022-0F9F3CBC9D0BB4DB</a>. Poets and attendees alike will add to the rich history of Parsons Lodge as a center for conversation and community.</p>
<p>Parsons Lodge is a place where the walls talk. Take note of the pink feldspar and grey granite stones that form the walls of the lodge. Though varying in shape, from polished and rounded, by the process of mechanical weathering, to sharp and angular, each was gathered nearby and deliberately placed, over 100 years ago. The rustic lodge sits low, in harmony with the surrounding environment; an unobtrusive answer to the Sierra Club's desire for a meeting place that would survive the trying conditions of the high country.</p>
<p>Enter through the arched wooden door, and bear witness to the fireplace, books and benches that have facilitated a decade's worth of conversation. Six large windows allow unbridled flow between nature and architecture; recent Parsons speaker Rue Mapp read to an audience during a thunderstorm. The auditory and visual presence of rain demanded listeners to connect Rue’s story of Black joy in nature, with the resource itself. Look up and trace the lodgepole pine beams that line the ceiling. These beams have supported the roof through sun, rain and snow, and have overseen years of historical connections and decision-making.</p>
<p>Remember that the journey begins not when you enter Parsons Lodge, but the moment you step out of your car. As you stroll to the lodge, observe meadow penstemon, Belding's ground squirrels, and mineral water bubbling out of Soda Springs, and let inspiration and creativity lead the way.</p>

The largest wetland restoration project in Yosemite National Park's history is underway at the picturesque 230-acre Ackerson Meadow. Despite its beauty, 90 acres of rare wetland habitat have been lost and 100 acres are at risk from a century-old erosion gully that has eroded more than 150,000 cubic yards of rich meadow soil. You can visualize this as more than 15,000 10-yard dump trucks. The erosion gully rapidly drains water from the meadow, dries soils, causes loss of water-loving plants and animals, and impacts endangered species. The partnership to restore Ackerson Meadow (American Rivers, U.S. Forest Service-Stanislaus National Forest, Yosemite Conservancy, and Yosemite National Park) will restore and protect these wetlands by filling the erosion gully by fall 2024 and planting more than 425,000 native wetland plants and 700 pounds of native seeds by spring 2025.

Art is anything but static. Japanese artist Chiura Obata, renowned for his studies of High Sierra and Yosemite landscapes, can be credited for facilitating a cross-cultural dialogue that emerged at a time of necessity and continues to spark connections to place and identity today. Obata worked in ink and watercolor and used traditional Japanese printmaking techniques, capturing the subject matter of Yosemite in a style that many Americans weren't accustomed to. His intricate works express not only the grandeur of the ‘Great Nature’ he took inspiration from but prompt conversation about using art as both an outlet and a refuge. Using art as an escape was particularly applicable in 1942 when Japanese Americans, including Chiura Obata, were incarcerated in concentration camps across the US. During this time, Obata taught art to help other imprisoned people process their collective and individual grief and displacement.</p>
<p>Many people form relationships with Yosemite without ever visiting. Their first link to this place may be through a photograph, film or piece of art that evokes an emotion; joy, wonder, comfort, curiosity or longing. Obata's work does this for a wide audience, sparking an appreciation of Yosemite for its intrinsic and sometimes seemingly intangible values.</p>
<p>Join us for our third annual Obata Art Weekend, where we celebrate the legacy of Obata and redefine our relationships with the world and each other through art. Between August 25 to August 27, there will be a series of workshops, roundtable discussions and other events held by NPS and our park partners.

Today is #GreatAmericanOutdoorsDay in honor of the third anniversary of the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA). This legislation provides funding to improve infrastructure and expand recreation opportunities in national parks and other public lands. In Yosemite, we’ve been busy using this funding for critical infrastructure projects throughout the park, one of which is the Rehabilitation of the Tuolumne Meadows Campground. With 26.1 million of funding provided through GAOA, our largest campground is in the middle of a major overhaul. The Tuolumne Meadows Campground hosts more than 150,000 campers each summer and was built by the Civilian Conversation Corps in the 1930s. This project will enhance the visitor experience and modernize the campground by replacing water lines, upgrading restrooms, improving accessibility for visitors with disabilities, reorganizing campsites, hardening parking pads, addressing drainage issues, replacing picnic tables and fire rings, as well as repairing structures damaged from heavy snowfall. Learn more: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/gaoa-tuolumne-meadows-campground.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/gaoa-tuolumne-meadows-campground.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/gaoa-tuolumne-meadows-campground.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Other projects funded through GAOA include the rehabilitation of the Glacier Point Road (nearing completion), major upgrades to The Ahwahnee (currently underway), rehabilitation of the Crane Flat Campground (nearing completion), rehabilitation of the Bridalveil Creek Campground water system (complete), and repairs and replacement of high voltage transmission lines (complete).</p>

<p>Yosemite National Park has a rich history of implementing prescribed fire since the 1970s. </p>
<p>How did these past actions influence the impacts of the 2022 Washburn Fire and help protect the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias and the community of Wawona?</p>
<p>Park scientists, fire managers, and collaborators conducted a study to examine the effects of past management on forest structure within, and fire effects from, the Washburn fire. They found that past fire management and roadside thinning reduced tree density and forest fuels, ultimately reducing fire behavior in those areas; allowing better firefighter access and safety during suppression efforts to protect the grove and community of Wawona. The findings and subsequent publication are especially important in informing current fuel reduction practices and making sure every effort is in place to reduce the negative impacts of future fires, described in "Last of the Monarchs" (video on our Instagram). “How forest management changed the course of the Washburn fire and the fate of Yosemite’s giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum)” can be found at <a href="https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42408-023-00202-6" id="https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42408-023-00202-6|" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#myModal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-remote="/common/commonspot/customcf/modals/modal_intercept.cfm?targetURL=https%3A%2F%2Ffireecology.springeropen.com%2Farticles%2F10.1186%2Fs42408-023-00202-6">https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42408-023-00202-6</a>.</p>

Yosemite National Park will begin a second round of civic engagement to address improving visitor experience and access to the busy park during peak season. The park is seeking input on several key concepts to address improving visitors’ access to and experience of the park’s most significant resources and features while ensuring that those resources are protected.
<p>The 8-week public comment period begins today and will last through September 6, 2023. A virtual public meeting will be held on July 19 at 4 p.m. PDT. For more information and to submit a comment, please visit the project website.</p>
<p>"The plan will address the intense congestion visitors are experiencing this summer and will serve as a guide to protecting Yosemite's resources and ensuring a high quality visitor experience," said park superintendent Cicely Muldoon. "This is the opportunity to help shape Yosemite's future."</p>
<p>During the first round of public engagement on the planning process December 9, 2022 through February 3, 2023 the park received almost 7,000 comments. The comments helped inform the development of management concepts and refine issue statements. Comments gathered during this period will help the park refine preliminary ideas, strategies, and concepts and will inform the development of future management alternatives.</p>
<p>Yosemite National Park has piloted reservation systems for the last three summers. In 2020 and 2021, the park piloted a reservation system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the park implemented a “peak hours” reservation system due to extensive construction that was going on throughout the park. There is currently no entry reservation system for 2023, allowing the project team to observe and test the efficacy of those changes and document what issues persist after the implementation of these parking lot and roadway configuration changes.</p>

<p>Yosemite has been very busy this summer. Arrive by 8 am to avoid long lines to get into the park and full parking lots once in the park. If you arrive later than 8 am on weekends and some weekdays, here is what you should expect:</p>
<p>-You will wait in line at park entrances for two hours or more.<br>
-You will encounter additional delays with very slow or stopped traffic once inside the park, especially in Yosemite Valley.<br>
-You will not be able to find parking.<br>
-You will not be able to get to eastern Yosemite Valley. Once the Valley is full, all vehicles are turned around near El Capitan.<br>
-You will not be able to use shuttle buses because they are full (if possible, bike or walk to get around).<br>
-You will see lots of people on trails.<br>
-You will wait in line at visitor service facilities (visitor centers, food service, restrooms, etc.).</p>
<p>Reservations are not required to visit Yosemite this year. Reservations were required in the summers of 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic and in summer 2022 when numerous key visitor attractions were closed for critical infrastructure repairs. We have been grappling with congestion—even gridlock—for decades. We want to build from the lessons learned from the last three summers of managed access.

<p>To help traffic flow like Yosemite Falls, especially on busy weekends, we strongly recommend that you arrive before mid-morning and pre-purchase your entrance pass to Yosemite online.</p>
<p>You are, of course, welcome to purchase your pass at an entrance station upon arrival, however, pre-purchasing it helps our friendly keepers of the gates get you on your way to your next adventure faster.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/sitepass/74296" id="https://www.recreation.gov/sitepass/74296|">https://www.recreation.gov/sitepass/74296</a> to select the pass type that suits you best, then print or download the digital pass. In the park, connectivity is limited, and you must be able to display your pass at any point.</p>
<p>Visiting Yosemite in a rental car and don’t know your license plate number? Fear not, you can select ‘rental car’ under car type on the online form.</p>
<p>While waiting in line, get your pass and ID out to show a ranger. Turn up the brightness of your screen to help them see the digital pass.</p>
<p>If you heed our advice and get stuck in the line, we recommend having an audiobook or playlist downloaded offline or using the time to narrow down your bucket list of hikes and sights once in the park.</p>

JOB OPPORTUNITY: Interdisciplinary Engineer (Mechanical / Electrical)</p>
<p>Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's....a new HVAC unit!</p>
<p>With so many people coming to Yosemite National Park (over 5 million in 2016!), there is a need for infrastructure to support visitors and staff alike, and a resulting need for people to take care of those facilities. Buildings in Yosemite have electrical, mechanical, heating/ventilation/air-conditioning (HVAC), and fire suppression. The utility infrastructure needed to support these buildings includes primary and secondary electrical distribution, substations, transformer stations, switchgear, controls, primary and backup power generation systems, lift stations, and photovoltaic (PV) systems. All these systems require maintenance, repair, operation, and eventually replacement. We’re looking for an Interdisciplinary Engineer (Mechanical/Electrical) to provide technical direction and coordination for these tasks.</p>
<p>If you are a mechanical/electrical-focused engineer with a passion for helping to maintain our national park resources, consider applying for this opportunity with Yosemite’s Design &amp; Engineering team.

Air Quality Awareness Week (May 1-5): Prescribed fire is used as a tool to mitigate poor air quality, health, and safety impacts of catastrophic wildfires.\</p>
<p>Over the last fifty years, wildfires have burned more and more acreage each year in the United States. As the number of wildfires increase, so do public health risks from exposure to fire and smoke. Exposure to wildfire smoke is tied to respiratory illness, cardiovascular issues, and other health risks including premature death.</p>
<p>One strategy used across the country and here in Yosemite National Park to mitigate wildfire risk is prescribed burning which is fire ignited under specific conditions to reduce fuels (e.g. dead and downed trees) in targeted areas. Although both prescribed fire and wildfire smoke are associated with impacts to air quality and human health, prescribed fires are implemented under conditions that limit harmful smoke exposure. In contrast to wildfire, prescribed burns are conducted when weather conditions are favorable for less smoke production and wind patterns allow for better smoke dispersal and for smoke to move away from populated areas.</p>
<p>A 2022 report prepared for and funded by the American Lung Association found differences in smoke composition, amount of emissions, and duration of exposure between wildfires and prescribed fire. While prescribed fire may result in smoke exposure, the overall air quality and health impacts are typically much less than that of wildfire smoke. This is due to the low intensity and relatively short duration of prescribed burns. Additionally, prescribed burn activities can be planned under specific, predictable conditions that offer the opportunity to prepare and notify communities in advance so people can plan accordingly which helps to further reduce smoke exposure.</p>
<p>Learn more about actions that you can take to reduce the risks of wildfire smoke exposure with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Smoke-Ready Toolbox for Wildfires: <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smoke-ready-toolbox-wildfires" id="https://www.epa.gov/smoke-ready-toolbox-wildfires|">https://www.epa.gov/smoke-ready-toolbox-wildfires.</a></p>

Even though Yosemite’s high country is still blanketed in snow, it’s time for our winter rangers to say farewell for the season. Rob and Laura experienced an extremely memorable winter in Tuolumne Meadows and worked tirelessly during the parade of storms that slammed the Sierra Nevada all winter. They are probably happy to take a break from shoveling snow for some time! They left parting updates about current snow conditions, avalanche hazards (that may continue through spring), and wildlife that is starting to make themselves known as spring awakens. Until next time! <a aria-label="Link https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-18-2023-last-update-for-the-season.htm" href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-18-2023-last-update-for-the-season.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-18-2023-last-update-for-the-season.htm">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-18-2023-last-update-for-the-season.htm</a></li>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Each year, visitors to Yosemite leave behind approximately 24,000 camp fuel cylinders, objects that qualify as hazardous waste and prove costly to recycle. Yosemite Conservancy’s Zero Landfill Initiative, in a partnership with Subaru of America and the National Parks Conservation Association, is excited to announce a refillable fuel cylinder exchange program to combat this unique challenge. When you next camp in Yosemite, consider participating in this project. Help us reduce the amount of trash that ends up in local country landfills so that enjoying the park’s landscape need not result in the spoiling of another.  </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We have a lot of snow! The April 1 snow surveys in the Merced and Tuolumne River basis showed snowpack (based on water content) was a little over 240% of average, which is a record. There are an estimated 139 billion gallons of water in the form of snow in the watershed that feeds Yosemite Valley.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This will make for spectacular waterfalls... maybe too spectacular. There may be some periods between late April and early July when Yosemite Valley is inaccessible due to flooding. River-related recreation, like rafting, swimming, and picnicking in picnic areas along the river, is likely to be unavailable until sometime in July even when Yosemite Valley is open.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">At the same time, Tioga, Glacier Point, and Mariposa Grove Roads will open much later than usual.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">So, if you're planning to visit during this time, be prepared to be flexible and arrive early to avoid traffic and full parking lots.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Well, the data is in, and for the standard April 1 snow survey window, this winter was indeed the snowiest Tuolumne Meadows winter on record! With data from our survey sites extending back to 1930, the previous record was the winter of 1983 had an average of snow depth of 168.84 inches and 66.98 inches of snow water equivalent (SWE). On April 1 this year, no joke, we documented an average snow depth of 177.3 inches and 79.68 inches of SWE!

Winter kept an icy grip on Tuolumne Meadows during the first full week of spring. With 17 inches of new snow and temperatures reaching as low as -15°F, it felt like winter to our rangers up in the high country. Brrrrr.</p>
<p>This winter has been one for the record books and California keeps on setting new ones. In a recent snow survey at Dana Meadow, Rob and Laura measured 162.45 inches of snow and 72.75 inches of snow water equivalent (SWE- how much water is in the snowpack). Compare that to 8 years ago at the same place and time, they measured 11.5 inches pf snow and only 4 inches of SWE during the extremely dry winter of 2015.

Several weather systems hit the Sierra Nevada this past week adding more water to the snowpack with 24 inches of new snow at their place. They have been enjoying some excellent ski conditions, though are wary of slab avalanches in the area.

<p>This summer, rivers and creeks swollen by runoff from snowmelt will be dangerous. Powerful current, icy water, and river obstructions can trap or kill the unwary. Stay away from river and creek banks during high water conditions and avoid rock hopping. Stream polished rocks along the water's edge may be slippery when wet or dry.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Trails are still snowy. Lodging only partially reopens tomorrow, but all that is far less of a concern if you’re a bird! Peregrine falcons have begun nesting in the park again high up on the granite structures, a perfect place to scout out prey below before plummeting upon them at insane speeds. While exploring the park, be sure to look up! You just might get to see a precipitous peregrine plummet in action, but for those of you who love being on the big walls almost as much as the birds, this gets a bit more complicated.<br>
<br>
Climbing closures are now in effect through July 15 to help protect our local population of these impressive creatures that had become extirpated from the park by the 1970s. The closures are updated regularly to provide both sustainable protection for active breeding peregrine pairs and maximal climbing access. So, before heading out on a climb, please check for current route closures on our information boards at Camp 4, El Capitan Bridge, and certain approach trails or online: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/climbingclosures.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/climbingclosures.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/climbingclosures.htm</a><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">JOB POSTING: Civil Engineer (Structural Focus)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Did you know there are well over a thousand buildings and other structures in Yosemite National Park? Many of them, such as this leaning maintenance shed, weren’t designed to handle the snow loads we experienced in this year's winter storms. Designing for the repair and rehabilitation of these facilities presents a complex series of challenges for our architects and engineers. Our engineers also contribute to the design and construction of new and replacement facilities, such as this water tank at Bridalveil Creek Campground and trail bridge at Glen Aulin.If you are a structural-savvy civil engineer with a passion for helping to maintain our National Park resources, consider applying to this opportunity with Yosemite's Design &amp; Engineering team. In this job you will serve as the team’s subject matter expert for structural engineering. This position will be responsible for both design and project management of a wide variety of project types, including small structure foundations, building rehabilitations, trail bridges, and much more.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The snow just keeps on coming in the high country. According to our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers, the settled snow depth up there is now at 146 inches, topping out the previous record from 1983 by six inches! That amount snow can cause a fair number of difficulties, like the loss of commercial power. They’re doing just fine in such conditions, but they did have to keep it short this week.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rest assured that despite all the snow that the season has thrown (and continues to throw) at them, our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers are still alive and well, and completing snow surveys to boot! Since February 21, they’ve received 133 inches of new snow, and the constant storms certainly didn’t make their job easy. They haven’t had much time for “tiddledywinks nor jig-saw puzzles” as Yosemite’s 1933 “The Skier’s Ten Commandments” demand. (For context, Jules Fritsch was the first formal ski instructor at Yosemite’s ski school).

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">At the time of publishing this post, The Big Oak Flat Road (the extension of HWY 120 within the park) is closed. Meanwhile, both the El Portal Road (the extension of HWY 140 within the park) and Wawona Road (the extension of HWY 41 within the park) are at R3 conditions, meaning that tire chains are required on all vehicles, no exceptions. All roads within Yosemite Valley are also at R3, and additional closures are possible. Those who must travel to and from the park today should use HWY 140; however, we strongly discourage travel due to the severe winter conditions which are forecast to continue over the weekend and into next week.</p>

Last week was cold and dry in Tuolumne Meadows, but that has changed this week, and our winter rangers are likely getting dumped on during this current winter storm. Long before Rob and Laura’s tenure and well before the inception of the Tuolumne Meadows winter ranger program in 1973, there was another married couple who enjoyed working in a snowy environment and saw the potential for winter recreation in Yosemite. In 1928, Mary and Don Tresidder of then Curry Company shared the passion of sliding on snow and promoting winter sports in Yosemite Park.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rockfalls are a natural and dynamic geologic process involving the detachment and rapid downward movement of rock. Due to its steep, glacier-carved cliffs, Yosemite Valley experiences many rockfalls each year. Historical records indicate that more than 1,500 rockfalls have occurred in the park since 1857. Massive piles of "talus," or rock debris, at the base of Yosemite Valley's cliffs are reminders of these dramatic events. Rockfalls help to create the beautiful and changing scenery in Yosemite National Park, but they also present potential hazards.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rockfall hazard zones occur throughout the park near any cliff faces. If you witness a rockfall from the Valley floor, quickly move away from the cliff toward the center of the Valley. If you are near the base of a cliff or talus slope when a rockfall occurs above, immediately seek shelter behind the largest nearby object. After rocks have stopped falling, move quickly away from the cliff toward the center of the Valley. Be aware that rockfalls are inherently unpredictable and may happen at any time. Pay attention to warning signs, stay off of closed trails, and, if unsure, keep away from the cliffs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Remember that Yosemite is a wild place. Rockfall is the most powerful geologic agent acting today in Yosemite. The dramatic cliffs of Yosemite are constantly being shaped by this potent natural force.</p>

Warm, dry, and windy. Those are the conditions our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers experienced this past week. The mercury topped 50°F this week above 8,000 feet for the first time in nearly two months. There was also a wind event over the weekend that saw northeast winds in excess of 50 mph for a 24-hour period. Ski conditions fluctuate from day to day with the weather du jour. In a year like this, even the most fit visitors will find it difficult to make it from the Lee Vining Gate to Tuolumne Meadows in a day, especially with a heavy pack. So, if you are planning a trip to the Tuolumne Meadows Ski Hut, or any other winter wilderness destination, plan accordingly!

For our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers, last week started warm and dry and ended cold and wet. They were happy to see the storm come through over the weekend which brought fresh snow (14 inches of it!), high winds, and cold temperatures. Ski conditions were vastly improved by the new snow. Evidence of coyote and long and short-tailed weasels were seen in the snow up high this week, as well as sightings of golden eagles and a white-tailed jackrabbit.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Glacier Point is looking a bit truer to its name with all that ice. As the water cycles through periods of gently melting (during the day) and refreezing (overnight), the sheets of ice can take on new shapes, weaken, and sometimes disrupt its own winter serenity with quite a bang. If you’re in the right place at the right time, you just might get to see some ice collapse. Regardless of where you’re standing in the Valley, you’ll very likely hear it. They sound a lot like a rockfall, which this same mechanism can also trigger, so use caution if you’re planning to hike up any of the open trails that ascend the walls. Good sense and good gear help make for a good time. Consider bringing traction devices for your footwear to more safely traverse slippery ice patches you may encounter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you’re not here yet and afraid you’re going to miss all the snow and ice, worry not! For just as the marmot, er, groundhog, has ordered, we’ve got another winter storm warning for Saturday evening through Sunday night. Currently the Valley floor is forecast for a few inches of snow with the higher elevation roads potentially getting about a foot of snow. Tire chains will be required. You can call our road status phoneline anytime at 209/372-0200 (then press 1 and 1 again) for current conditions, including active chain restrictions and road closures</p>

January brought a lot of snow to the Sierra Nevada, with 181 inches of snow falling in Tuolumne Meadows! Our winter rangers are halfway through this month’s round of snow surveys and just got back from one of the more rustic outposts, where they melt snow for water and cook over a wood burning stove. This month they found the stove pipe under ten feet of snow! </p>
<p>Aside from wind scoured slopes in the alpine, snow coverage is excellent for this time of year even on many south-facing slopes. The average snow depth of their snow surveys completed so far is 122 inches and the central Sierra Nevada is presently above the April 1 average for water content of the snow.</p>
<p>Despite all the snow, bears are still active in the park, and our winter rangers found tracks following their ski tracks even above 8,000 feet. Bears won’t always hibernate if they have enough food to make it through the winter. It’s important to stay vigilant about food storage year-round.

The skies finally cleared over the Sierra Nevada this week. Par for the course, the epic, powder-filled snowstorms of the past three weeks were replaced by windstorms. Our winter rangers took advantage on their recent day off, while the winds were exceeding 100 miles per hour at the highest of elevations, to bake their first loaf of sourdough bread of the season...YUM. To live in winter conditions for months at a time such as they do, they must be prepared and resourceful; shopping for all five months over the course of three days in October, then hoping that their food stash is stored well for their December through April stay in Tuolumne Meadows.</li>
<li>Rob and Laura took the opportunity that the clear weather provided last week to take a three-day patrol to Tioga Pass and Lee Vining Canyon. Not surprisingly, they found the Tioga Pass Entrance Station and related building buried in snow. In addition to lots of avalanche activity and debris in the area, they also saw a white-tailed ptarmigan blending in with its snowy surroundings.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Lower Yosemite Fall footbridge and portions of the western and eastern arms of the trail are temporarily closed due to a heavy flow of frazil ice from the falls. “What's frazil ice?” you ask? It’s when fast-moving, turbulent water gets so cold it forms what looks like a slushie but one more dangerous than delicious. As you can see, it’s filled in the Yosemite Creek drainage beneath the falls and overtaken the bridge and trail. While its lava-like flow may mesmerize the eye, frazil ice is a deceptive hazard. It’s not a solid surface despite its appearance, so when its slush hides the boundaries of sure footing, falling in and becoming trapped beneath is a serious risk. Additionally, we’ll need to look at what it did to the bridge once it melts out. In the meantime, enjoy these videos or see the frazil ice for yourself from the open portions of the trail.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sixty-four inches of new snow in Tuolumne Meadows sure makes for a lot of work for our winter rangers. Good thing they’re no strangers to the mighty snow shovel… or to long miles of breaking trail in these conditions. Finally, though, a blue sky, and wildlife, including this white-breasted nuthatch, too, enjoyed the cheerful brilliance after monotonous days under the weight of the storm. If you choose to go join them, mind the hazards this weather sequence can bring.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Cathedral Rocks may know how to dress in this fresh layer of snow, but be careful on the roads as this storm has caused another rockslide.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hwy 140 is currently closed outside of the park due to a rockfall between El Portal and Midpines. For road conditions outside the park, you can call the Caltrans status hotline at 1-800/427-7623. For road conditions inside the park, you can call our hotline at 209/372-0200 (then press 1 and 1).

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you’re planning on visiting Yosemite on a weekend in February to see this waterfall - or anything else in the park - set your alarms for tomorrow morning! Yes, tomorrow, January 13, at 8 am Pacific Time the first 50% of reservations for the last three weekends in February (i.e., Feb. 10-12, 17-19, and 24-26) become available online at <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/" id="https://www.recreation.gov/|">Recreation.gov</a>. The remaining 50% will be released at 8 am Pacific Time two days before the reservation date (e.g., the remaining 50% for February 10 become available 8 am on February 8). No reservations are required for the first weekend in February (Feb. 3-5).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you first arrive Mondays through Thursdays (and keep the receipt), you won’t need a reservation as the $35/vehicle entrance fee is valid for seven consecutive days, regardless of day of arrival. Also, if you have lodging reservations in Yosemite Valley, Wawona, Foresta, or Yosemite West, or campground reservations in Upper Pines, Camp 4, Wawona, or Hodgdon Meadow Campgrounds, you won’t need an additional reservation. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It’s been a wet and windy week here in Yosemite (and all over parts of California)! What does that mean for our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers? It means 75 inches of new snow and a whole lot of shoveling. With new snow that deep, it’s going to take at least a few days of settlement to make traveling any distances a reasonable or safe option. With the possibility of more snow this weekend, that window may be even more limited. One of their thoughts regarding avalanche conditions: “With recent high winds, the chalkboard is constantly being erased before we even lay eyes upon it. It will be interesting to see what has happened once the dust has fully settled.” Read more snow travel tips, wildlife notes, and other updates in this week’s post: <a aria-label="Link https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-10-2023.htm." href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-10-2023.htm." rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" target="_blank" title="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-10-2023.htm.">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-10-2023.htm.</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Why did the bear cross the bridge? To get to the other side, and nothing more, we hope!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">During the winter, some bears will come and go from hibernation, while others may just never tuck in for the season if there’s enough food to go around. This means that, just like us, they’re willing to wander through the snow from time to time to see what they can find. It’s unclear whether they appreciate Yosemite Falls in the same manner that we do this time of year, but we certainly do know that they’ll enjoy your lunch, perhaps more so than you, if they can get to it. Since it’s bad for both you and the bear if the bear succeeds, here are some food storage guidelines that’ll keep everyone happy and healthy during your winter visit to Yosemite:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Please keep all food and scented items, regardless of packaging, within arm’s reach. If there’s food in your pack or cooler, that means your pack or cooler is within arm’s reach.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Food and scented items can be stored out of sight in your vehicle during the day. Overnight, please store these items inside your hotel room with windows closed or secured in a food locker.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Dispose of all trash in proper bear-resistant trash can or dumpster, reattaching the clip of the can or dumpster if it has one. If no trash can is available, please pack your trash with you until you find one.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Maintain a safe and respectful distance of about fifty yards away from any bear you may encounter. If you are unable to safely retreat if a bear approaches within that distance, please scare it away by shouting loudly and aggressively.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Please report bear encounters by calling 209/372-0322. If a bear is lingering in a developed area or is trying to acquire human food, call 911.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">These practices encourage our bears to have longer, healthier lives. You can read more about food storage policies here: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/bears.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/bears.htm|">www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/bears.htm</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Join the conversation and help plan for Yosemite’s future! Mark your calendar for January 17, 2023, at 4 pm PT and join a virtual public meeting to discuss how best to manage visitor access to Yosemite.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In December we launched the first phase of the Visitor Access Management Plan. Yosemite National Park’s primary and daily focus is ensuring world-class experiences, a welcoming environment for all visitors, and protection of nationally significant resources. Like many parks across the system, providing for and managing use at Yosemite is increasingly complex due to growth in day-use visitation and changing use patterns.  The purpose of this plan is to evaluate how different management strategies, including reservation systems, could help meet long-term resource and visitor experience goals.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The initial comment period is open now and will close on February 3, 2023. We want to hear from you! There will be a virtual public meeting on Tuesday, January 17, 2023 from 4 to 5:30 pm PT; park staff will share information and answer questions.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers ended the year with rain, but that was quickly (and thankfully) followed by more snow. There is now about six feet of snow at Tuolumne Meadows (8,600 feet/2,600 m elevation) and more in the forecast. As you can imagine, this makes ski conditions quite variable. With not much time in between storms, snow hasn’t had time to settle so it can be slow and arduous to get to your destination. Avalanche activity has been observed along the Tioga Road and other areas. It’s extremely important to be prepared when venturing into the wilderness in winter. Check out this week’s update for more information: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-3-2023.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-3-2023.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-3-2023.htm</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A winter storm warning is in effect for Yosemite National Park through the morning of January 6th. High winds are forecast to bring heavy precipitation across the park, potentially including one to three feet of snow at places like Crane Flat along Big Oak Flat Road (the extension of Hwy 120 within the park) and Chinquapin along Wawona Road (the extension of Hwy 41 within the park). Call our road status hotline anytime at 209/372-0200 (then press 1, 1) for current road conditions and closures. Tire chains will be required: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tirechains.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tirechains.htm|">go.nps.gov/chains</a></p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers will be back with their weekly reports after the new year, but until then left us with one more update for 2022. While there was no new snow last week, they report that early season ski conditions are excellent. The common ski lexicon of “boot top powder” pretty much sums it up. The snow surface is supportable enough that skis do not penetrate much deeper than six inches. Boot penetration, however, is much deeper and one would not want to currently be caught out in the Sierra Nevada without snow travel tools like skis, split boards or snowshoes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Read through their full blog post for more information on conditions, wildlife sightings, and avalanche reports: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-20-2022.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-20-2022.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-december-20-2022.htm</a></p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">What do you need to build a home? Traditionally, in these mountains, you just need community, ingenuity, and the confidence of a tree. This is an umacha, a traditional bark house of the park’s seven associated tribes: The Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, Bishop Paiute Tribe, Bridgeport Indian Colony, Mono Lake Kootzaduka’a, North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California, Picayune Rancheria of the Chukchansi Indians, and the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians. Construction begins with cedar poles secured by wild grapevines while the cedar bark plating must come from a carefully selected source. If the tree is only recently dead, the bark won’t easily separate into the convenient shape. If the tree has been dead too long, well, then you might carry that decay into the walls of your house. Wisdom suggests at least two years’ time for a deceased, old cedar works best; two years grant you the inheritance of a cedar’s resilient pride against the elements to shelter your family for years to come.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">You can find examples of umachas behind the Yosemite Museum in the Indian Village, a reconstruction from the 1970s of various native structures that have seen continuous use ever since for tribal events and ceremonies. Those of you #ParkedAtHome can read about the Indian Village here: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/indian-village-of-the-ahwahnee.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/indian-village-of-the-ahwahnee.htm|">www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/indian-village-of-the-ahwahnee.htm</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">But no matter where you may be this winter, an appreciation for the umacha isn’t far away. Just look around your own residence, wander its space, explore its features. It’s probably built out of something other than cedar bark and grapevines, but the sentiment is the same. It keeps the winter out. It keeps you in. It’s home, irrevocably so.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We all know the notion of having - or sometimes, unfortunately, only wanting - a place to be. From this, perhaps we can work towards a more expansive generosity.  </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This a model of it in the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Errr, I guess here on the internet it’s actually a picture of a model of Yosemite Valley in the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center. Clearly, it’s not quite the same, but on these rainy and snowy days, you can’t see much of the real thing anyway. Even on the valley floor, the clouds are obstructing any view of the above cliffs, but there’s still much to do in the park on days like these. Swing by the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center to explore exhibits on the park geology, ecology, and history beginning with the natives’ original occupancy of the land. Just next door is the Yosemite Museum where you can see for yourself the ingenuity and craftsmanship of native culture in the Indian Cultural Exhibit.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Yosemite National Park is initiating a public comment period for a Visitor Access Management Plan today. The park will seek input on how visitors can plan future visits to one of the most popular sites in the National Park System.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A series of public meetings, both virtual and in-person, will begin in January 2023. The 8-week public comment period will last through Feb. 3, 2023.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Yosemite's primary focus is to ensure visitors are not only fully welcomed into the park, but they get a world-class experience," said Yosemite National Park Superintendent Cicely Muldoon. "This is a bustling park and providing for and managing visitation has become increasingly complex due to growth in day-use visitation and changes in how visitors enjoy the park."</p>

<p>Yosemite National Park will require reservations for the last three weekends of February 2023.</p>
<p>During that time of year, thousands of visitors visit Horsetail Fall, a waterfall that creates the illusion that the water is on fire. The surge in visitation has led to full parking lots, parking overflowing into traffic lanes, pedestrian-vehicle conflicts causing safety issues, and damage to natural and cultural resources. In order to manage this event, a reservation will be required to drive into Yosemite National Park on the weekends of February 10–12, February 17–19, and February 24–26, 2023. Visitors who first arrive Mondays through Thursdays won't need a reservation. The $35/car entrance fee is valid for entry for seven days, regardless of day of arrival. Reservations will go on sale for that event at Recreation.gov on Jan. 13, 2023 at 8 am PST. Each reservation will be valid for seven days.</p>
<p>As previously announced, we will not implement a reservation system for the summer of 2023. However, we are initiating a public comment period for a Visitor Access Management Plan today.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">As part of Native American Heritage Month, we invited native employees of the National Park Service in Yosemite National Park to speak of their work in, their connection to, and their history with the park. Today, meet Emily!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Emily is a member of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, born and raised in Mariposa, California. She is also Chukchansi. She graduated from Sonoma State University with a Bachelor of Art in History and recently finished her Master of Arts in Cultural Heritage Management from Johns Hopkins University. She started working for Yosemite as a Student Conservation Association intern as an Indian Cultural Demonstrator after she graduated from Sonoma State. She also interned with U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Forest Service before coming back to work in Yosemite National Park as an Interpretive Park Ranger and Indian Cultural Demonstrator.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"I love working in this park. I grew up coming here, all my field trips were mostly here. I grew up hearing stories from my great grandmother about growing up in the village here and the connection my people have to this place. It holds a special place in my heart, and I get to share their story every day I come to work both from a historical and present-day perspective. I studied untold stories when I went to college and I feel so fortunate telling the story of my people from the perspective of us, as native people and not from a mis-recorded story in a book. The look on my elders face when they see me in my park service uniform is a look I’ll always carry with me."</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The snow’s back! Time again to don your coats and festive cheer and come romp in the gifts of the season. But, before you do, let’s talk about the trails… As you can see, they look a bit different now under winter’s temperament. Here’s a winter hiking update:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Our trails in the late fall through early spring pose new challenges even to confident summer hikers. Many trails, including those on the Yosemite Valley floor, become slick from ice and frost while those at higher elevations are lost under snow. Traction devices for your shoes are strongly recommended. Furthermore, orientation and navigation tools, along with the knowhow to wield them, are a good idea, especially on longer adventures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· The tops of Vernal and Nevada Falls remain open but only through our alternate winter route: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/vernalnevadawinter.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/vernalnevadawinter.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/vernalnevadawinter.htm</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· The Four Mile Trail is closed above Union Point (about two-thirds up the trail) due to treacherous conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">· Please respect trail closures. As frustrating as they may be to your plans, no photograph or itinerary is worth a fatal risk to yourself and Yosemite Search and Rescue staff. Come prepared with the necessary gear and have the courage to back down if the conditions outmatch your expertise. You can review current park conditions here: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htm</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now that being said, go out and play!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The enormous, nearly 400-year-old namesake sugar pine of Sugar Pine Bridge in Yosemite Valley fell over last month, a consequence of its failing health in recent years. Graciously, in its thunderous collapse, it spared the adjacent historic bridge.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">While we lament the loss of such a beautiful, long-lived tree, its fractured form will now serve a new purpose in its afterlife. Large wood, like our pine, that falls into rivers provides critical structure and habitat to a healthy river's ecosystem. The stream’s current tosses about the wooden fragments, often lodging pieces into the banks and thereby slowing the flow of the river. At this slower pace, water can then to jump up into the adjacent floodplain to nourish riparian plant species. Additionally, the submerged wood provides shelter and nursery habitat for fish along the banks, and the accumulation of trapped leaves and other woody debris fosters smaller aquatic insect populations that form the base of the food chain for all other river dwellers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Our river restoration projects often mimic this natural process by reintroducing large wood back into the river to jumpstart the ecological mechanisms that support river health. You can find examples of this type of riverbank restoration project along the Merced River just downstream of the Ahwahnee Bridge and Stoneman Bridge in Yosemite Valley. These projects are part of a larger effort to restore the Merced River as outlined in the Merced River Plan.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Glaciers’ repeated advances and retreats over the last 2 million years played an important role in sculpting Yosemite’s landscape, but most of this ice melted away by about 10,000 years ago. During a more recent cold period called the Little Ice Age, small glaciers reformed below the highest peaks. Currently, two glaciers remain: the Lyell and Maclure glaciers. They are among the longest studied glaciers in North America and are critical to local ecosystems in providing a year-round supply of cold water to the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">On August 21, 1872, naturalist John Muir installed five wooden stakes in Yosemite’s Maclure Glacier, surveying in their locations by sighting “past a plumb-line, made of a stone and a black horse hair.” He returned on October 6 and found that the stakes had moved 47 inches, or about an inch per day, proving that the Maclure Glacier was a “living glacier.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In 2012, scientists repeated Muir’s experiment using modern techniques. They found the Maclure Glacier moving at an inch per day—the exact same rate measured by Muir 140 years earlier despite a much smaller glacier in 2012. They also noted that the nearby Lyell Glacier did not move at all, probably because it is too thin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This year scientists reproduced Muir’s experiment again—150 years ago to the exact day! They found that the Maclure Glacier has slowed down, now creeping three-quarters of an inch per day. The Lyell Glacier remains stagnant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Since 1883, both glaciers have lost 90% of their volumes. Soon to be absent altogether, they are among Yosemite's most visible indicators of climate change.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Haven’t you heard? It’s Bat Week! Yosemite National Park is home to 17 different bat species including the Spotted Bat (Euderma maculatum) which has the largest ears of any other bat in North America. Bats emit sounds which bounce off objects around them and back into their ears creating a picture of sound so they can navigate in the dark. While most bats emit at a frequency higher than humans can hear, the Spotted Bat and fellow Yosemite resident, the Western Mastiff Bat (Eumops perotis), can be heard clicking and chattering as they whizz through the night sky catching their meal of insects.<br>
<br>
Are you spooked by bats? They’re not interested in eating you, they’re interested in eating bugs! They keep the mosquito and other harmful insect populations at bay, pollinate many of our favorite foods, and help plant populations by spreading seeds.

It's autumn and the leaves aren't the only thing coming down...</p>
<p>The Half Dome cables are down for the season. With the cables down, we strongly discourage hikers from attempting to summit. Summiting Half Dome with the cables down requires technical knowledge, experience, and equipment. With autumn weather remaining good at least for the next several days, all other trails have good conditions. However, weather can change quickly and unexpectedly this time of year, so be sure check the weather forecast (<a href="https://go.nps.gov/wxmap" id="https://go.nps.gov/wxmap|">go.nps.gov/wxmap</a>) and be prepared for cold temperatures, rain, and even snow.</p>
<p>The Half Dome cables are typically up from late May through early October, and a permit is required during that time: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdpermits.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdpermits.htm|">www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdpermits.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Yosemite National Park’s Ahwahnee Hotel to Undergo Major Upgrades<br>
Funded by the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA), Yosemite National Park was recently awarded an approximately $31.6 million construction contract to upgrade the historic Ahwahnee Hotel. The project includes a major seismic upgrade throughout the historic hotel as well as a kitchen renovation. Kitchen project work is currently underway and work to upgrading the seismic safety will begin near the end of the year.</p>

<br>
A huge shoutout to all the entrance station rangers, supporting park staff, and Yosemite Conservancy volunteers who serve as the face of Yosemite and are often the only park personnel that visitors interact with. Entrance station staff greeted an estimated 2 million visitors this summer!<br>
<br>
The peak-hours reservation system was successful, and the park is grateful for the collaborative effort in implementing the system. The park is now analyzing data from this summer to evaluate the program and document what was learned this summer. The park continues to plan for future visitor access and will include the public in any planning efforts.

Dressed from head to toe in personal protective equipment (PPE), wildland firefighters stay safe as they respond to fires within national parks and provide support for interagency partners.<br>
<br>
- Helmets protect firefighters from falling branches and debris<br>
- Safety glasses and sunglasses are essential pieces to keep eyes safe while battling fire and smoke<br>
- Nomex shirt in bright yellow is made of flame-resistant material designed for protection and high visibility<br>
- Backpack that stores water and a required fire shelter – a safety device that is deployed as a last resort when trapped in a wildfire<br>
- Leather boots with high ankle support, are worn to travel long distances through harsh elements<br>
- Leather gloves keep hands safe from burns and other injuries<br>
- Nomex pants provide protection with plenty of pockets and are also made with flame-resistant material<br>
- Tools such as a shovel are used to dig or scrap vegetation and soil to build a fireline.<br>
<br>
Yosemite’s fire season started in June this year, but wildland firefighters and support personnel work all year to keep people and property safe while maintaining fire-adapted ecosystems.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We expect busy conditions in the park this weekend! #PlanLikeAParkRanger by reading the tips below to have an enjoyable and safe trip.<br>
<br>
🔥 Air quality in Yosemite Valley has generally been very unhealthy in the mornings, improving to good to moderate in the afternoons. When AQI is very unhealthy, people sensitive to smoke should avoid all physical outdoor activity and everyone should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. Check current air quality at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/nature/aqmonitoring.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/nature/aqmonitoring.htm|">go.nps.gov/aq</a>.<br>
<br>
🚭 There are currently two fires in the wilderness: the #RodgersFire and #RedFire. Fire restrictions are in effect below 8,000 feet and smoking is restricted parkwide visit <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/firerestrictions.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/firerestrictions.htm|">www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/firerestrictions.htm</a> for details.<br>
<br>
🥵 We are experiencing a heat wave. Bring and drink water throughout the day and plan your adventures accordingly by venturing out early or later in the day to avoid extreme heat. Eat salty snacks, or drink electrolyte beverages, to maintain a proper balance of electrolytes. Spend some time appreciating trees and rest frequently in the shade.<br>
<br>
😎 Cool down and avoid the smoke by visiting some indoor options like the Valley Visitor Center, Museum, The Ansel Adams Galley, or Happy Isles Art and Nature Center.<br>
<br>
🏊 Chilling by the beach and taking a dip in the cool water is a great plan but did you know bears like beaches too? Make sure you keep food or any items with a scent (trash, sunblock, lip balm) within arm’s reach. You may also store food in your car during the day if all windows are completely closed and food is out of sight. Help us keep bears and all wildlife save -- never leave food unattended outside.<br>
<br>
📍 Reservations are required to drive into or through the park during peak hours, 6 am – 4 pm. Peak hour reservations are all sold out from 9/3 – 9/5. Not able to get a reservation? You can center the park before 6 am or after 4 pm (give yourself enough time to arrive by 6 am, if you arrive at an entrance station after 6 am you will be turned around).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It’s getting hot out here. So, make sure you’re prepared. Yosemite is experiencing a heat wave with temperatures reaching over 100°F in the Valley. Keep yourself cool by following these heat-safety tips:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>
<p>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after your adventures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat salty snacks and/or drink beverages with electrolytes; electrolytes are equally important to keep your body hydrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be mindful of your limits and take frequent rests in the shade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect yourself by wearing sunprotective clothing and a hat to prevent your skin from getting sunburnt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might be in tiptop shape, but high elevation and high temperatures might hit different. Plan accordingly and avoid strenuous activity when temperatures are at their highest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know when you go. If you are going to the restroom frequently, you will need to replenish your body with fluids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take care of your furry friends by checking the heat of the pavement. If the road is too hot to the touch for you, it’ll be too hot for your pets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">When visiting Yosemite and any other outdoor space, it is important that you plan ahead and come prepared.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Calling all big wall climbers! In 2023, Yosemite National Park will transition from the Wilderness Climbing Permit Pilot Program (in place in 2021 and 2022) to a long-term solution to address wilderness stewardship through management of overnight climbing on Yosemite’s big walls and other rock formations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We will be accepting written comments through November 13, 2022 and hosting a series of townhall meetings and other outreach events. We want to hear from you!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Big wall climbing is a valued opportunity to experience Yosemite's wilderness. "Big wall climbing" includes climbs of length and technical complexity that require typical parties to take more than one day to complete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cumulative effects of big wall climbing have led to degradation of wilderness values. Issues include proliferation of litter, human waste, abandoned property, improperly stored food, illegal fire rings and wind breaks, and preventable accidents. Despite extensive efforts by Yosemite climbing rangers and climbing stewards to improve education and outreach to climbers, increase patrols, and coordinate targeted clean-ups, there are still unacceptable impacts to the Wilderness character of Yosemite climbing areas.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We plan to have the following options for you hear from park staff and share your thoughts:<br>

<p><strong>August 22, 2022</strong></p>
<p>Two natural, lightning ignited fires continue to burn in Yosemite’s Wilderness. The Red Fire is 749 acres, and the Rodgers Fire is 150 acres. Both fires are being managed by fire crews and firefighters continue to work to confine and contain them within natural barriers.</p>
<p>With a recent increase in temperatures, along with a high-pressure system, air quality may be affected in various areas of the high country and in Yosemite Valley for the remainder of the week. Some smoke is visible in the Tuolumne Meadows area, and a pattern of smoke settling in Yosemite Valley during the night, with improving conditions beginning in late morning is expected. The best time of day is late afternoon into early evening.</p>
<p>For the most part, these fires are low intensity, creeping, and smoldering through the smaller fuels and burning through mostly dead trees and brush. Ultimately, managing these fires will result in a healthier forest.</p>
<p>A temporary trail closure is in place in Rodgers Canyon from Neall Lake to the junction with Table Lake. There are no threats to infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We are sad to report that pioneering Yosemite scientist Jan van Wagtendonk died on July 15.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Jan was a Yosemite and National Park Service legend: an accomplished scientist, a preeminent fire ecologist, a wilderness advocate, and a beloved colleague. He was an innovative wilderness manager, coming up with the trailhead quota system that we still use today to protect wilderness while ensuring that hikers are free to enjoy that wilderness on their own terms. His impact affects fire policy to this day as one of the authors of the first federal fire policy in 1995. Jan possessed an amazing intellect, deep humility, a sharp wit, and a profound love of Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Jan was a strong advocate for returning fire to the Sierra landscape. His pioneering use of prescribed fire in the early 1970s in and around the Mariposa Grove started us on the path to reestablishing an ecological balance lost in over 100 years of fire suppression.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">There is poetry, in the words of Jan's son Kent, that in Jan's final days the fruits of those efforts had a direct and dramatic effect in saving the Mariposa Grove from the Washburn fire, which started just outside of the grove.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Our heartfelt condolences to Jan's family and wide circle of friends and colleagues. He was one of a kind, and will be deeply missed. <br>

This landmark legislation provides funding to improve infrastructure and expand recreation opportunities in national parks and other public lands. One of the projects funded in part by the Great American Outdoors Act is the Glacier Point Road rehabilitation project. While the road is closed this year, we are planning to reopen it (with delays) in late spring 2023.<br>
<br>
We are not just completely repaving the deteriorating Glacier Point Road, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Repairing curves leading down to Glacier Point. This road segment contains steep and narrow hairpin curves that drop 600 feet over 1.6 miles. </p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Improving the pullout overlooking the Clark Range to address safety hazards.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Repairing road areas west of Summit Meadow to prevent the continued settlement of the road.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias has seen minimal fire impacts due to a long history of prescribed burning and a proactive fire management and fuels reduction program. As a result, there have been no known loss of any large giant sequoias. This is in contrast to the nearly 20% loss of giant sequoia in the last few years during large-scale wildfires. Conditions in the fire perimeter include heavy dead and down vegetation due to a mono wind event in 2021, effects of climate change and drought, and bark beetle kill. -- @yosemitefire</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the last several weeks, National Park Service personnel trained on both short-haul and hoist operations. Rescuers, firefighters, and/or patients can be inserted or extracted, even from vertical terrain, via helicopter using either short haul or hoist. What's the difference?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Short haul is how the park's contract helicopter inserts or extracts rescuers, firefighters, and/or patients in a harness or litter. They are suspended a fixed distance under the helicopter (typically 150 feet, but up to 250 feet) and picked up and dropped off. The park contract helicopter is used for various mission, including dropping water on fires, transporting people, transporting material, and searching for missing people.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">When the park helicopter is unavailable, a California Highway Patrol helicopter may respond equipped with a hoist. In this case, the rescuer starts out inside the helicopter and is lowered to the ground to be inserted, or a rescuer or patient is hoisted from the ground into to the helicopter. Another type of insertion is via rappel, in which rescuers or firefighters’ rappel from the helicopter as it hovers up to 300 feet above the ground.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The search and rescue team and firefighters are ready to help, but we hope you will never need their services.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Today marks National Wildland Firefighter Day, a day recognizing the nation’s wildland firefighters and support personnel. As summer progresses and temperatures rise, the threat of wildfires increases. Yosemite firefighters and support staff rise to the challenge of protecting lives, property, and the cultural and natural resources of the park. Thank you to all the wildland firefighters, rescuers, and support staff in Yosemite and across the country.<br>
<br>
Help firefighters prevent accidental wildfires. Never leave a fire unattended and make sure that campfires and barbeques are completely out and cold to the touch before leaving a campsite or picnic area.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hiking, picnicking, spending time with family and friends, or simply enjoying time outdoors: there are many ways to recreate and celebrate Fourth of July at Yosemite National Park. Here are some reminders if you’re planning to visit during the Independence Day weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Yes, you guessed it right. Make sure you have an entry reservation when driving into or driving through the park between 6 am – 4 pm. Learn more about entry reservations by visiting <a href="go.nps.gov/reserve" id="go.nps.gov/reserve|">go.nps.gov/reserve</a>.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>If you are planning to arrive after 4 pm, please do not arrive at a park entrance station until after 4 pm. Do not try to arrive early.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Consider using the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System - YARTS to get to the park (you do not need an entry reservation when taking YARTS). A reservation is strongly recommended. Learn more about YARTS by visiting <a href="https://yarts.com/" id="https://yarts.com/|" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#myModal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-remote="/common/commonspot/customcf/modals/modal_intercept.cfm?targetURL=https%3A%2F%2Fyarts.com%2F">https://yarts.com/</a>.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Masks are again required indoors and in enclosed public transportation due to high COVID-19 community levels.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Fireworks are strictly prohibited in the park. If you have a barbeque or campfire, make sure the coals are cold to the touch before leaving.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Take care of yourself. Be aware of the signs of overheating and overexertion. Be mindful of warm temperatures and drink plenty of water.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Do not arrive at Yosemite without an overnight reservation if you plan to spend the night. All campgrounds are sold out through the Fourth of July weekend. Camping or sleeping in a vehicle is only allowed at a campsite you have reserved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We all recreate outdoors and celebrate the holiday in our own way. Be kind to fellow visitors and have fun!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Planning on visiting Yosemite with your dog? As much as we love our furry family members, national parks are not always the best place for pets. The B.A.R.K. Ranger Code is an easy way to remember how to visit Yosemite responsibly by doing the following: Bag your pet’s waste, Always leash your pet, Respect Wildlife, and Know where you can go. Help keep Yosemite wild by always abiding by the B.A.R.K. Ranger Code on your visit, or leave your pet at home if this might be difficult. Pets who do not follow the B.A.R.K. Ranger Code can damage park resources, disturb wildlife in their natural habitat, participate in unsafe activities, and impact the experience of other visitors.

<p>Driving up Highway 120 of Tioga Pass, you’ll see Chiura Obata’s sign near the eastern entrance of Yosemite National Park. Last August, the road was dedicated to honor Chiura Obata’s life, work, and legacy. Park staff from Yosemite National Park, Honouliuli National Historic Site, Manzanar National Historic Site, Channel Islands National Park and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area were present for the dedication ceremony, as well as two of Obata’s grandchildren, Kei Kodani and Kimi Hill.</p>
<p>Chiura Obata (1885-1975) was a renowned Japanese American artist and one of California’s most influential artists of the 20th century. Obata first visited Yosemite in 1927 for a six-week trip to the High Sierra where he spent his time sketching and painting the tall granite peaks, sparkling lakes, and dramatic views. This landscape profoundly impacted the rest of his career and deepened his love for Dai-Shizen, or “Great Nature,” the powerful influence the natural world has on our lives.</p>
<p>Although Obata went on to become a professor at UC Berkeley in 1932, he and his family, along with people of Japanese ancestry living in the west, were incarcerated after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Sent to Tanoan Assembly Center and Topaz Relocation Center, Obata continued to create artwork and co-founded art schools in these camps to serve his community. </p>
<p>Through his dedication, many others were able to take up art during the most treacherous of times, creating connections with the landscape, with each other, and with their own humanity through Obata’s programs. </p>
<p>You can see some of this work at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/yosemite_landscape_art/artists.html" id="https://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/yosemite_landscape_art/artists.html|">https://www.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/yosemite_landscape_art/artists.html</a>.</p>
<p>Lead by Robert Hanna, a descendant of conservationist John Muir, the Chiura Obata Great Nature Memorial Highway will continue to serve as a stunning reminder of the unique artistic and historical influence the eastern Sierra holds as well as the diverse history of our parks.</p>
<p>Tioga Road is open for the season. A reservation is required to drive through the park (<a href="https://go.nps.gov/reserve/" id="https://go.nps.gov/reserve/|">go.nps.gov/reserve</a>), although the sign is reachable from the east side before entering the park.</p>

The rivers, creeks, and waterfalls in Yosemite are beautiful, but they are also very unpredictable and dangerous. Safely enjoy Yosemite’s water features by staying on trails and using bridges to cross rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Most accidents happen when people get too close to water to take photos, to play on rocks, or to take a quick dip to cool off. Be mindful that swift and powerful currents flow beneath seemingly calm water. Boulders next to rivers and waterfalls are extremely slick and treacherous to walk or climb on.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of water. Please stay on trails and be aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>If you plan to raft the Merced River, everyone on a raft must wear a personal flotation device. You can only put in your raft at or below Stoneman’s Bridge. In Yosemite Valley, the river is closed above Stoneman Bridge and below El Capitan Bridge. Plan accordingly and learn more about water activities by visiting: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/water.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/water.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/water.htm</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Exciting news! The Half Dome cables will be up for the season on Thursday, May 19, 2022. A permit is required to summit Half Dome. Most permits are available via a preseason lottery, but a limited number are available every day, two days in advance. All permits for May 19–May 26 will become available two days in advance. See <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/234652?fbclid=IwAR3v-gUiAvvGfyXTfkNVoeOUWqflIFw3jK5-ySDwVN2V49WHYsx2867C4L4" rel="nofollow" role="link" tabindex="0" target="_blank">https://www.recreation.gov/permits/234652</a> for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you will be hiking to Half Dome, be prepared with several liters of water, good hiking footwear, and a headlamp (with extra batteries). Be prepared to turn around if a thunderstorm appears possible. Stay back from the Merced River, which is running at high flow right now. If you see a bear on the trail or approaching you, scare it away by yelling loudly, aggressively, and persistently. Always keep your food within arm's reach. And enjoy the hike!</p>

<p>Happy Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month! During the month of May we celebrate the contributions and legacies of Asians and Pacific Islanders that have shaped the United States. </p>
<p>Yosemite National Park would not be the park we love and cherish today without the work of Chinese immigrants. They built many of the park’s early roads and were employed as cooks, gardeners, and laundry workers. Yosemite Park Ranger Yenyen Chan spent many years uncovering the Chinese history in the park. Chan’s efforts and the legacy of the Chinese workers can inspire us to continue to preserve and tell the diverse stories of our parks. </p>

<p>What is faster than a race car, can see a meal up to a mile away, and is exquisitely engineered for a vertical lifestyle?</p>
<p>A peregrine falcon, <em>falco peregrinus</em>!</p>
<p>The peregrine falcon was once extirpated from much of its native range, including Yosemite where it disappeared for decades, leading to its listing as an endangered species in the early 1970s. Because of the collaborative efforts of Yosemite climbers, Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, and National Park Service biologists, with generous funding from <a href="https://yosemite.org/" id="https://yosemite.org/|" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#myModal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-remote="/common/commonspot/customcf/modals/modal_intercept.cfm?targetURL=https%3A%2F%2Fyosemite.org%2F">Yosemite Conservancy</a>, the story of Yosemite’s peregrine falcon is one of hope.</p>
<p>In an era fraught with what often feels like insurmountable challenges, what does it mean to keep trying?</p>

<p><strong>April 7, 2022</strong></p>
<p>After completing some of the snow surveys, Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers Laura and Rob reflected on what they're seeing:</p>
<p>"The March weather summary tells the tale of the third month in a row of much drier and warmer weather for the winter. Equally concerning are the snow survey results for the April 1 surveys, which historically indicate the peak of water content in the Sierra Nevada snowpack. The Tuolumne River drainage comes in at 41% of 'average' for snow water equivalent. This average is derived from 91 years of snow surveying in this drainage. Although there have certainly been drier single winters during this period, the more alarming fact is the persistence of the drought over the past twenty years. As the drier-than-average years pile up with only a few wet ones thrown into the mix, the cumulative effects of drought become more apparent. In our short eleven-winter tenure here, we have seen the impacts of the drought, most notably in the tree mortality of the mid-elevation fir forests. Many dead trees stand with their needles still on them. Even the towering red firs that we once skied through to get to our Snow Flat survey are now just bare 200-foot-tall snags. And the 'drought tolerant' junipers on the south slopes of Mt Hoffmann are struggling for survival."</p>
<p>On the bright side, conditions for skiing are still good right now! Read more at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-7-2022.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-7-2022.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-april-7-2022.htm</a>.</p>

A brief return to winter brought 8 inches of new snow to Tuolumne Meadows last week, allowing our winter rangers to enjoy good ski conditions as they conducted various work projects from their base camp near Evelyn Lake. Even though warmer temperatures are creating more bare ground, skis or snowshoes are still strongly recommended for visiting the Yosemite high country. Their snow travel tip of the week discusses how to navigate snow bridges safely in spring. It’s very important to make safe decisions in order to avoid hazards below or downstream from these rapidly disappearing crossings. The signs of spring continue with more bird sightings, and evidence of bighorn sheep, badgers, and bears. Read all about it in this week’s blog post: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-march-29-2022.htm?fbclid=IwAR3VVQlk_l3w0jb8c-mNY_20aNl6HmWYANrcJafEeWXyImFdn7HNvEqk2k4" rel="nofollow" role="link" tabindex="0" target="_blank">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-march-29-2022.htm</a>.</p>

Snow is melting faster this week in Tuolumne Meadows as the weather is reaching near record high temperatures. For our winter rangers, the mating calls of birds and sound of rushing water now compete with the sound of the wind in the trees. This spring-like weather makes for a variety of conditions above 7,000 feet where creative route finding is necessary as the snow on south facing slopes at all elevations is becoming a patchwork of bare ground and snow. That said, the skate ski conditions along the Tioga Road and in Tuolumne Meadows are some of the best they’ve seen in the past decade despite the lack of new snow in 2022.

In only seven days, our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers experienced practically all four seasons’ weather! Starting with freezing temperatures at night, then warm spring-like days with increasingly abundant sunshine, and finally a return to winter with snow showers and northeast winds at the end of the week. With five inches of new snow, the ski conditions are variable depending on the aspect and elevation with good coverage between 8,000 and 11,000 feet on all but south aspects. Current snow depths in the Tuolumne Meadows area range from 3 to 6 feet.

With a steady flow of water and a recent dip in temperatures, Yosemite Creek had a short-lived episode of frazil ice. Under the right conditions turbulent water will become supercooled, reaching temperatures below freezing. Ice crystals can form quickly and accumulate into a slushy flow that might back up and spill over chaotically in the creek drainage. The aftermath looks like tongues of chunky ice filling in between dry creek banks.Warmer weather means we don’t expect see this in the coming weeks, though it is more common in March and April.

Giant sequoia trees are impressive in size, age, and resilience. This resilience is being tested by climate change and previous management practices. These challenges offer opportunities to research these wonderful trees and develop better ways to support their ability to thrive. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=794A4AB1-8821-4FC7-9ED0-E1F3F98E408F">Video (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">At the park’s lower elevations it can be hard lately to remember that it is winter. Yosemite Valley has had recent highs in the 70s and the snow patches have gotten thin. The Tuolumne rangers still have plenty of snow to explore but after six dry weeks even the high country is feeling dry. As always, they have some fun observations in their weekly update: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-february-15-2021.htm">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-february-15-2022.htm</a><br>

<p>Still no new snow, but lots of wind! Lately it seems that the only variable in Tuolumne Meadows is how high the winds are blowing. Snow coverage in the Tuolumne Meadows area remains excellent but our winter rangers are seeing more bare ground being exposed in other areas.

Yosemite Rockfall Year in Review: 2021<br>
2021 proved to be a relatively mild year for rockfalls and other slope movements in Yosemite. Forty-seven rockfalls were documented in 2021, with a cumulative volume of about 1,570 cubic meters (4,670 tons). Both metrics are below recent averages, perhaps related to below-average precipitation in 2021. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=FD5E8943-046C-4A2E-857ADD5C1E8B71AF" id="https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=FD5E8943-046C-4A2E-857ADD5C1E8B71AF|">https://go.nps.gov/1374i2</a></p>

<p>While compiling the January weather data, our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers had only one lone entry of a trace amount of snow during a record dry month at their weather plot. The good news is that the heavy snows of December have left a central Sierra Nevada snowpack that is still 92% of “normal” for February 1. This percent of normal number is derived from the February 1 snow surveys, and the automated snow sensors that are scattered throughout the state.</p>
<p>With no recent snow, the high alpine snow surface is wind hardened and textured. For these conditions, this week they share a lot of suggestions and information about equipment, specifically about “skins.” Ever wonder how backcountry skiers travel uphill with a little more ease? Historically, various Arctic inhabitants attached seal skins to the base of skis to gain traction on the snow. The modern version of climbing skins is typically made of either nylon, mohair (Angora goat hair), or a blend. Check out this week’s blog entry for more tips, a January data summary, and some winter birding observations: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-february-1-2022.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-february-1-2022.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-february-1-2022.htm</a>.</p>

The only storm our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers saw last week was one that brought wind. Though not a “Mono Wind” event, the windstorm brought strong winds for 48 hours, with some gusts exceeding 100 mph along the crest! This further textured, hardened, scoured, sublimated, and eroded the alpine snowpack. Because the snow has set up more, coyotes and other critters that don’t have wide, snowshoe like feet are able to travel farther distances without as much effort, which helps to conserve their energy. Check out this week’s entry to learn more about mammal tracks, touring conditions, and tips about gear for easier snow travel: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-26-2022.htm." id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-26-2022.htm.|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-january-26-2022.htm.</a></p>

Last week fire crews completed ignition of 50 burn piles around the Hetch Hetchy Entrance Station and 10 piles in the Mariposa Grove. As weather and air quality conditions allow, starting tomorrow, January 25, through the end of the week, fire crews plan to continue work in the Mariposa Grove and Wawona area, as well as around Crane Flat. Smoke may be present throughout burning operations and may linger into the following weeks as larger logs are consumed.</p>
<p>Mechanical thinning (the removal of some trees to reduce hazards and/or density in a forest) and pile burning is one of our fire management tools that helps to prevent larger fires. It also provides "defensible space" around structures in the event of an unwanted fire, which can help firefighters better defend buildings and communities. Burning some of the debris in place allows us to reintroduce limited healthy fire to these areas and continue cycling nutrients back into the soil.</p>

<p>Our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers patrolled west last week and experienced a wide range of snow and ski conditions. If approaching the high country from Yosemite Valley, you should anticipate hitting snow line just below 7,000 feet, and if coming from east of Tioga Pass, snow line starts around 8,000 feet. With many places of firm snow out there, the rangers share some great tips about when and how to use ski crampons. Other observations last week included the elusive sooty grouse, old avalanches along the Tioga Road, and some pretty sweet sunsets!

Warm and windy days brought a grab bag of ski conditions for our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers last week: wind crust, sun crust, breakable, supportable, soft, hard, and ice! Looking for snow travel tips when it comes to skis, bindings, and boots for these high country conditions? You’ll find some in this week’s blog post. Rob and Laura are currently on patrol to dig out one of the snow survey huts in preparation for the park's first snow survey of the year later this month, so we’ll see what this week brings for them as they head west from Tuolumne Meadows.

“I think we are programed to go for adventures, to explore, to acquire on our own, and you can’t convey that on a television screen. It has to be done kinesthetically, hands on.” -  E.O. Wilson</p>
<p>The influential scientist, naturalist, and conservationist Edward O. Wilson passed away in the last week of 2021 at the age of 92. A childhood vison injury led him to focus on the small things in nature. He took this inspiration to the far corners of the globe as perhaps the foremost researcher on ants, but also as a synthesizer of ecological relationships and a contributor to the understanding of biodiversity.</p>
<p>His most lasting contribution might be in passing on his exuberance for discovery across many generations and sharing his passion for all living things. In the 1980s he coined the term biophilia for the common desire in humans to seek connections with nature. Wilson believed that fostering this innate love of life in all its forms was the surest way to protect it for future generations.</p>
<p>Wilson saw the value in national parks and other protected landscapes as both refugia for biodiversity and places to inspire human connection with the other living things in nature. Yosemite rangers had the pleasure of hosting E.O. Wilson on a visit here about ten years ago. After a long career filled with the advancement of knowledge but also the frustration of witnessing firsthand the catastrophic loss of species, he still showed his graciousness and wonder. His life was an embodiment that our inspiration from nature has no bounds. That, in fact, finding joy in ecological exploration leads to even more wonder. That, just as ecosystems thrive by mutual relationships, humans thrive through mutual inspiration.</p>

Let it snow! With 78 inches of new snow this past week in Tuolumne Meadows, it marked the snowiest December on record (since 1980). While this doesn’t translate to the most water, the fresh snow has kept our winter rangers busy shoveling, breaking trail, and collecting data.<br data-text="true">
<br>
An important distinction to make is the difference between “new snow” or the amount of snow falling in a 24 hour period (measured on a “storm board” which is cleared every 24 hours: HN24), the settled snow depth (measured by a permanent snow stake that fluctuates throughout the winter as new snow falls and settles over time: HS), and the water content of new snow (the method historically used here is to melt the snow gathered in a rain gauge and then measure the height of the water in a calibrated cylinder every 24 hours: HN24W). By this metric there have been wetter Decembers based on water content (perhaps there was rain, and/or the snow had a higher water content), but the 154 inches of snow measured so far this month is the “highest” recorded at the Tuolumne Meadows plot in 42 years of record keeping!<br data-text="true">

<p><strong>December 3, 2021:</strong> We are piloting a lottery system for North Pines Campground reservations for arrival dates from July 21 through September 14, 2022. Successful lottery applicants will have an opportunity to make a reservation for campsites in North Pines Campground during an early access period. The early access period will occur before the traditional on-sale dates, with any remaining availability becoming available on the usual on-sale dates.

<p>The demand for reservations in Yosemite campgrounds through Recreation.gov far exceeds availability, especially in Yosemite Valley during the busiest times of the year. This has been the case for decades and demand has only increased over time. More than ten thousand people visit Recreation.gov during Yosemite’s on-sale dates in hopes of getting a reservation. On the busiest on-sale dates, reservations sell out in minutes. Hopeful campers take days off work and recruit family and friends to simultaneously try to make any possible reservation. Still, many are unsuccessful year after year, causing frustration, disappointment, and feeling the system is flawed and unfair. We regularly receive complaints from users saying they were unsuccessful because they are not computer savvy, their computers or internet connection are not fast enough, or that bots (automated computer systems) got all the reservations, or that some users receive preferential treatment. The early access lottery pilot is an attempt to address these concerns. Based on an equitable, randomized system, the lottery assigns a limited number of successful applicants a period before the general on-sale during which they can make a reservation. While the lottery does not guarantee your desired dates or campsite will be available, it limits the number of users competing simultaneously for campsites during peak-season dates.</p>

<p>Fall has arrived, bringing cooler, wetter weather. In anticipation of favorable conditions, we are planning to build on our 51-year legacy of prescribed burning by conducting several prescribed burns. The proposed burns are in western Yosemite Valley, Crane Flat area, and just south of Wawona (Studhorse). Burning of debris piles is planned in several other locations throughout the park this fall and winter.</p>
<p>Prescribed fire is the most effective and efficient way to decrease the risk of unwanted wildfires; smaller prescribed fires now prevent larger uncontrolled fires (and widespread smoke) later. Fire reduces accumulation of pine needles and cones, down branches, and smaller plants and trees, allowing larger, more fire-resistant trees to thrive and keeping forests healthy. Frequent fire also improves habitat for wildlife, promotes giant sequoia reproduction, and makes forests more resistant to drought. Recognizing its many benefits, Native people have used fire on the Yosemite landscape for thousands of years.</p>
<p>You can find details on these proposed burns at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/yosemite-fall-winter-prescribed-burns-2021-4.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/yosemite-fall-winter-prescribed-burns-2021-4.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/yosemite-fall-winter-prescribed-burns-2021-4.htm</a>.

<p>Yosemite National Park’s story has many chapters. Yes, the granite domes and cliffs, the waterfalls, and the giant sequoias have long been main characters, but the storyline and added props have changed over time.<br>
<br>
Have you ever stood somewhere in awe of the natural beauty around you, only to learn later that the exact same spot once looked quite different? Perhaps you’ve stood in the middle of Yosemite Valley looking up at the sheer granite walls and never thought about the ground beneath your feet as serving a completely different purpose in the past. Maybe it was a hotel, or an elk paddock, a road, or a landing zone for a plane.<br>
<br>
Yosemite: Then and Now takes you on a photographic journey that tells these stories by matching archival photos with photos taken in the same locations today. Familiar places in Yosemite that serve as a touchstone for you may have once looked quite different.<br>

Recent testing yielded positive results for small amounts of toxic algae in Tenaya Creek in Yosemite Valley, and toxic algae may exist in other sites in Yosemite Valley. Toxins are concentrated within the algal mats themselves and released episodically into the water when the algae dies or is disturbed. </p>
<p>What does this mean for me? </p>
<p>For your safety, do not enter or drink from Tenaya Creek, which flows from above Mirror Lake to where it enters the Merced River near North Pines Campground. <br>
Filtering and/or boiling the water is not effective against this type of algae.  <br>
Prevent pets from drinking the water and eating or touching algae. In particular, prevent dogs from eating dried algal mats on shore.  <br>
<br>
<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="0" href="https://go.nps.gov/report-hab" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Please report</a> any large algal blooms and/or algae that is particularly bright, bubbly, strange-looking, or appears like a haze in the water. <br>
<br>
Do not disturb algal mats in any way. Wading or swimming can cause toxins to be released into the water. <br>
<br>
If you suspect a site has toxic algae, do not enter the water and do not drink water from the area. While some sites are signed based on testing results, it’s likely that algae exists in other parts of Yosemite Valley. Don’t rely on signage alone.  <br>
<br>
Can I still swim in the river? Can I still filter or treat the water for drinking? <br>
Water that is clear with no visible algae in the area presents a low risk. Even in areas with no visible algae, watch for isolated clumps of algae floating by.  <br>
<br>
If you think algae may be in the water: <br>
• Do not enter the water. <br>
• Do not drink the water, even if treated. <br>
• Do not let pets into the water, allow them to drink the water, or eat algae on the shore. <br>
<br>
What are the signs and symptoms of exposure to toxins from algae? <br>
According to the <a href="https://www.mywaterquality.ca.gov/habs/resources/human_health.html" id="https://www.mywaterquality.ca.gov/habs/resources/human_health.html|">California Water Quality Monitoring Council</a>, the following signs and symptoms may occur within 48 hours of exposure to a waterbody with a suspected or confirmed algal bloom: <br>
• Sore throat or congestion; <br>
• Coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing; <br>
• Red, or itchy skin, or a rash; <br>
• Skin blisters or hives; <br>
• Earache or irritated eyes; <br>
• Diarrhea or vomiting; <br>
• Agitation; <br>
• Headache; and/or, <br>
• Abdominal pain. <br>
<br>
If people show symptoms of cyanotoxin and/or cyanobacteria exposure after contact with water, or with scums or mats of algae, they should receive immediate medical attention. Additional resources are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and by contacting the California Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222). See the HAB-related Illness Tracking webpage for information on previously reported human illnesses related to HABs in California.<br>
<br>
Is the park monitoring for harmful algal blooms?<br>
The park continues monitoring for toxic algae and testing for toxins throughout the park. You can learn more about harmful algal blooms at <a href="https://mywaterquality.ca.gov/habs/" id="https://mywaterquality.ca.gov/habs/|">https://mywaterquality.ca.gov/habs/</a>. </p>

Visitors to Yosemite Valley last fall were more likely than usual to see a bear during their trip. Acorns dropping from Yosemite Valley’s black oaks were perfectly timed with black bears entering hyperphagia, a period when bears are looking for big calorie boosts (up to 20,000 calories every day or eleven pounds of acorns) as they prepare for winter hibernation. Other fall food sources may have fallen flat, making the acorns in Yosemite Valley a particularly big draw for bears. It was truly a sight to behold! Despite normally being solitary animals, numerous bears could were regularly foraging together in small areas due to the abundant food source. Sows were leading their cubs through their first acorn harvest and even exciting displays of the hierarchy among bears was playing out—with dominant bears (often the large males or defensive sows) chasing the more subordinate bears (often the smaller and younger bears) away from their feast.<br>
<br>
In years like last year when acorns are abundant, the trees attract bears which in turn attracts the attention of thousands of enthralled visitors. While these displays are exciting to witness, the proximity of some of these bear-filled oaks to busy roads, trails, and development can create big hazards for bears. Rangers extensively and creatively managed these areas in order to keep people back and allow these bears to remain wild. Initially, rangers tried scaring the bears away from oaks near trails and roads, only to have them return a few minutes later. The bears quickly made it clear that they weren’t going anywhere as long as the acorn feast remained. These bears triggered massive crowds and huge traffic jams (“bear jams”), which created some chaotic situations. Ultimately, a temporary trail closure gave bears and people a bigger buffer, and rangers spent most of their shifts monitoring the situation, keeping people back, and educating thousands of people about the importance of giving wildlife space as they admired the agile tree climbing eating machines.<br>
<br>
For bears, their natural fear of people is an important instinct that keeps them safe. When a bear becomes habituated, losing its natural fear of people, other behaviors can change and dangerous situations can evolve with people. This is why rangers staffed these areas from late August through November. Rangers also created a fun new display to show people exactly how far they should be from a bear: a fun wooden bear silhouette designed to stand a 50 yards down a trail from a sign with bear information on it. This sign explained what to do if you see a bear, and demonstrated exactly how far visitors should remain from bears in order to help keep them wild. All these efforts, as well as the interest that visitors took to learn and understand their role in protecting wildlife in national parks, helped make a difference in these acorn eating bear’s lives.<br>

Over the course of the summer, you assisted us in a search for Yosemite’s first ever B.A.R.K. Ranger Ambassador for a chance to have their photo featured in the Yosemite Guide newspaper and on our website to help others make safe and responsible decisions about bringing pets to the park. The top contenders were selected and you voted for the top applicant.</p>
<p>Please join us in congratulating Bear from Concord, California, as Yosemite’s B.A.R.K. Ranger Ambassador! Bear was chosen for exemplifying outstanding B.A.R.K. Code behavior while enjoying his favorite national park. Some of his model behavior includes: utmost respect of all wildlife, preparation and understanding of which trails pets are allowed, recreating responsibly with a travel water bowl and leash, and excellent Leave No Trace ethics by always cleaning up after himself.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Bear! You are setting a high bar for other B.A.R.K. Rangers to follow. Thank you to all B.A.R.K. Rangers who applied for the ambassador role. Through your actions, you are protecting the wild beauty of Yosemite for those who come after you!</p>
<p>As much as we love our furry family members, national parks are not always the best place for pets. Yosemite is wild! Help keep Yosemite wild by always abiding by the B.A.R.K. Ranger Code on your visit, or leave them at home if this might be difficult. The B.A.R.K. Code stands for: Bag your pet’s waste, Always wear a leash, Respect Wildlife, and Know where you can go. Pets who do not follow the B.A.R.K. Code can damage park resources, disturb wildlife in their natural habitat, participate in unsafe activities, and impact the experience of other visitors.</p>

<p>HEY BEAR, HI BEAR, GO BEAR!! How and when to scare away a bear in Yosemite</p>
<p>Here’s the situation: you are hanging out at your campsite or on a picnic area beach in Yosemite, when you hear a branch crack behind you. You turn around to find a bear approaching. What do you do?</p>
<p>You stand up, face the bear, wave your arms, and yell at the bear. We mean YELL at the bear, as loudly as you possibly can. Be aggressive with your voice and body language. You’re not just making noise; you’re scaring a bear away! You have to mean it for it to work.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of things you can yell:</p>
<p>HEY BEAR!!</p>
<p>GO BEAR!!!</p>
<p>GET OUT OF HERE BEAR!!</p>
<p>Or even just: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BEAR!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>One half-hearted yell may not be enough to scare a bear. So, keep yelling LOUDLY and AGGRESSIVELY until the bear leaves. Yell, clap your hands, wave your arms, hit a stick against a tree, get other people to help you yell! You can even throw small objects like pinecones or small pebbles at the bear to help scare it. (You’re trying to gently hit the bear with the pebble or pinecone—not injure it: Bears don’t like being touched.) Don’t chase the bear; just use your voice to scare it away.</p>
<p>Do you have time to snap a quick picture? No!</p>
<p>Do you have time to look around for a pot to bang or a whistle to blow? No! Use your voice! Your voice is your most effective tool to scare a bear away (and you don’t have to go looking for it... unless you’re really scared).</p>
<p>When a bear is around people, it could be only moments away from getting food, so you need to make it feel unwelcome immediately. Once a bear is eating food, it will be harder to scare away and much more likely to return in search of more food, ultimately getting itself into more trouble. We also want bears to be immediately afraid of people (as they naturally are), rather than assuming most people aren’t scary.</p>
<p>Bears that consume human food typically have decayed and damaged teeth. But that’s not the only negative consequence: when a bear gets food from people, even just a banana, the bear will change its natural behavior. Bears are extremely food-driven and a bear that gets human food will often become so bold in its attempts at getting human food that it has to be killed to protect people. So, when you see a bear approaching you or in any developed area (e.g., campground, picnic area, trail, parking lot), it is important to scare it away immediately, stopping this cycle, and helping keep the bear wild and alive. Yes, yelling at a bear helps keep it alive.</p>
<p>What about when you see a bear in a meadow, in the wilderness, or anywhere else away from human development or people—should you scare it? Generally, no. Do you have time to snap a quick picture? Probably, if you are at least 50 yards away from the bear. It can be one of the best Yosemite experiences getting to watch a wild bear do wild bear things.</p>
<p>Are you having trouble envisioning scaring a bear away? This video shows what it sounds and looks like. This advice applies in Yosemite; always check local recommendations when visiting bear country.</p>

<p>Speeding Kills Bear</p>
<p>We get this call a lot. Too much, to be honest. “Bear hit by vehicle, dead on the side of the road.” Sadly, it’s become routine. I log the coordinates into my phone, gather the equipment I may need, and head to the location. This call came in cold; it sounds like the collision happened sometime around noon and it’s 4 pm now. The location is an hour’s drive away, so by the time I get there it’s well after 5 pm. I pull off on the shoulder, lug a large backpack of equipment over my back, and head off down the road. My job here is easy, really: find the bear, move its body far away from the road to prevent any other animals from getting hit while scavenging on it, fill out a report, and collect samples and measurements for research. Then I’m off on my way again with another number to add to the total of bears hit by vehicles this year—data we hope will help prevent future collisions. Pretty callous. However, the reality behind each of these numbers is not.</p>
<p>Per the coordinates I was given, I’m still a few hundred yards off, so I continue down the road scanning it for blood as cars whiz by. I try to remember how many times I’ve done this now and, truthfully, I don’t know. This is not what any of us signs up for, but it’s a part of the job nonetheless. Then something catches my eye. It’s small and artificial, and laying in the middle of the road. As I walk closer, I see that it’s a broken shapeless car part, likely from an undercarriage. More cars whiz past. I turn my gaze from the car part down the embankment on the side of the road and there it is.</p>
<p>A cub. Its tiny light brown body laying just feet from me and the road, nearly invisible to every passerby. It’s a new cub—couldn’t be much more than six months old, now balled up and lifeless under a small pine tree. For a moment I lose track of time as I stand there staring at its tiny body, but then the sound of more cars whizzing by reminds me of my place and my role. I let out a deep sigh and continue on with my task.</p>
<p>I pick up the cub—it couldn’t be much more than 25 pounds—and begin carrying it off into the woods. I have no certain destination; I’m just walking until I can no longer hear the hiss of the road behind me. I see a grassy spot surrounded by a semi-ring of down logs and gravitate towards it. The least I can do is find it a nice place to be laid. I lay it down in the grass protected by one of the nearby logs and sit back on the log opposite of it, slightly relieved that it looks far more in place now than when I found it earlier. I take another moment and then continue with my work.</p>
<p>I slide off my backpack, remove a binder, and start the assessment. It’s a female. This immediately triggers thoughts of the life this bear may have lived—perhaps she would have had cubs of her own—but before I finish that thought I hear a stick break and look up. Just beyond the ring, there’s a familiar figure intently staring back at me. It’s another bear. Surprised, I stand up quickly and the bear runs off into the brush but stops not far off and looks back at me. Acting on instinct, I pick up a stick and smash it over a tree to scare the bear further away. I stand there quietly, listening as I hear the bear’s footsteps tapper away.</p>
<p>A few silent minutes pass, and I settle back into my task. Timely coincidence, I think at first. It could be a bear coming to scavenge or this could be a common crossing area for whatever reason—we did have another bear hit and killed not far from here last week. But then I hear it, and it changes my mind completely. From behind me there’s a deep toned but soft sounding grunt. I immediately know what it is. It’s a vocalization, the kind sows (female bears) make to call to their cubs. I turn and look in its direction and there she is, the same bear from before intently staring back at me. It’s no coincidence. I can feel the callousness drain from my body. This bear is the mom, and she never left her cub.</p>
<p>My heart sinks. It’s been nearly six hours and she still hasn’t given up on her cub. I can just imagine how many times she darted back and forth on that road in attempts to wake it. It's extremely lucky that she wasn't hit as well. The calls to the cub continue, sounding more pained each time. I glance back finding myself hoping it would respond to her call too, but of course, nothing. Now here I am, standing between a grieving mother and her child. I feel like a monster.</p>
<p>I get up, quickly pack my bag, and get out of there. It is time to go even though my task is not done. Quickly, I set up a remote camera. Why? Every year we report the number of bears that get hit by vehicles, but numbers don’t always paint a picture. I want people to see what I saw: the sad reality behind each of these numbers.</p>
<p>So please, remember this. Remember that when traveling through Yosemite, we are all just visitors in the home of countless animals and it is up to us to follow the rules that protect them. Go the speed limit, drive alertly, and look out for wildlife. Protecting Yosemite’s black bears is something we can all do.</p>

<p>The B.A.R.K. Ranger Code is an easy way to remember how to visit Yosemite responsibly with a pet. B.A.R.K. stands for: Bag your pets waste, Always wear a leash, Respect wildlife, and Know where you can go. Make sure to follow the B.A.R.K. Ranger Code on your next visit or leave your pet at home if this might be difficult for you. For more information visit: <a href="https://go.nps.gov/yobark?fbclid=IwAR1wCG0D9d0U6XPfaabrpAIYfQ-OpdA18JQlYgBjr1GU_dLc0S4JDs22BQE" rel="nofollow noopener" role="link" tabindex="0" target="_blank">https://go.nps.gov/yobark</a></p>
<p>Back in June, we asked you to submit photos of your own pet and tell us how they follow the B.A.R.K. Ranger Code. The most outstanding candidate selected will be named Yosemite's B.A.R.K. Ranger Ambassador and have their photo featured in our Yosemite Guide and webpage to help others make safe decisions about visiting Yosemite with a pet.</p>
<p>The results are in and we received well over 100 applicants! The competition was tough but with the help of Yosemite’s park rangers, we narrowed the search to five candidates. We are now asking for your help in crowning the top ambassador! Cast your vote by commenting on this post through July 21 with the applicant number who you feel upholds the B.A.R.K. Ranger Code best. If you plan to visit the park between July 14-21, you can also cast your ballot in person at the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center. Note, only one vote per person virtually or in person. The official ambassador selection will be announced later this summer.</p>
<p>We want to thank every B.A.R.K. Ranger who took time to apply. You are helping to protect Yosemite for generations to come and we appreciate your exemplary efforts!</p>
<p><strong>Applicant #1</strong><br>
Name: Gobi<br>
Hometown: Oakland, CA<br>
We love Yosemite and make it a point to visit every year. Last year, we took Gobi for her first visit to Yosemite. We stayed at a hotel close to the entrance and drove in first to Lower Yosemite Falls loop. We made sure to stay on the trail and always use a 6-ft leash. We then walked across Cook's Meadow to the chapel where we witnessed a small wedding party. Lastly, we took some photos on Berg Bridge and the Sentinel bridge over Merced River. We drove over to Mirror Lake and walked until the pavement ended and turned around. Gobi would be so honored to be selected as a B.A.R.K. ranger. She is a playful yet gentle dog who loves nature and all its wonderful smells. We take her along with us where we can and always make sure to do our research ahead of time. Gobi has gone through obedience training and listens to our commands ("leave it" or "heel") which come in handy at national parks. We are already planning our next trip to Glacier Point!</p>
<p><strong>Applicant #2</strong><br>
Name: Bear<br>
Hometown: Concord, CA<br>
Bear loves to hike &amp; camp. I rescued Bear from a life on a chain in a backyard in Stockton, Ca. A few months later I was in a battle for my life with stage 4 throat cancer. Bear was confused why we couldn't play together but remained by my side til I recovered. Since recovering (1+ year) we have been inseparable. Traveling the state on different hikes, kayaking and camping trips from Yosemite to Caspar Beach. Our favorite place is Yosemite National Park. Bear is extremely well behaved on trails where dogs are allowed and at all campsites (Mt Diablo State Park is where we call home). We always pick up after ourselves and leave no trace. I think Bear’s best asset in public parks is how he respects wildlife. He never attempts to chase after any. I have video of him standing silently as a herd of deer pass by us in Yosemite. We were on a footbridge and they passed just a few feet away and below us. Bear would make a great B.A.R.K. Ranger.</p>
<p><strong>Applicant #3</strong><br>
Name: Jack<br>
As my service dog he’s been with me from the top of Mt. Lassen peak, to the lowest point of Death Valley at Badwater Basin, and accompanied me on countless field trips while I studied geology. His first official BARK ranger badge was from Redwood NP and we’ve been looking forward to the addition of Yosemite. Jack has been to 8 National Parks including multiple trips to Yosemite, at least 5 national monuments, and countless national forests and other parks. We’ve always followed the BARK ranger principles, and now that Jack is retired we stick to the pet friendly trails. Please consider Jack to be a BARK Ranger Ambassador. He is the perfect candidate and deserves all the treats and praises.</p>
<p><strong>Applicant #4</strong><br>
Name: Stevie Nicks<br>
Hometown: Texas<br>
I practice the B.A.R.K. Ranger Code by always being informed of where I can and cannot go within each National Park that I visit. My mom always has my poo bags with us to ensure we leave no trace behind! I stay on a leash every time I get out of my car and work hard to be an example for other pups. My mom loves to photograph wildlife from her car… especially bears… so I sit very quiet and watch when we come across wildlife from the car. I love watching wildlife intently from the safety of my car. I would be honored to be able to help in educating other pups and their parents in safety and how to enjoy National Parks (especially Yosemite) by being respectful of the rules so nature and wildlife can be protected.</p>
<p><strong>Applicant #5</strong><br>
Name: Maya<br>
Hometown: San Diego, CA<br>
Maya absolutely loved going to Yosemite with her fur parents this past May! 🐶 We centered our Yosemite trip around Maya and spent weeks researching how to make it an awesome experience for her. 🏞 She definitely was a model Bark Ranger! We bagged all her waste💩, she was leashed 100% of the time (Maya loves her leash, it's a sign it's time for adventure!), Maya loves to watch squirrels 🐿 but she respected all squirrels and critters with plenty of distance and knew they just wanted to enjoy Yosemite too. No pavement? No thank you! Maya stayed on paved roads and we still got to take lots of cute pictures of her enjoying beautiful Yosemite ❤ 🌲</p>

Ranger Ambassador candidates will be selected by a panel of Yosemite park rangers and the official ambassador will be chosen by the public. Stay tuned for opportunities to vote later this summer!</p>
<p>And remember if you plan to bring a pet on your next visit to Yosemite, be prepared. If the activities on your itinerary are unsafe or do not allow for pets, consider leaving them at home. They will appreciate it!</p>

<p>The Ackerson Meadow complex spans from Yosemite into the Stanislaus National Forest and is the largest mid-elevation meadow in Yosemite. The meadow is important to a number of at-risk wildlife species including the State endangered great grey owl and little willow flycatcher. Currently, a large erosion gully network, up to 14 feet deep and 100 feet wide, is actively draining 90 acres of former wetlands in the meadow complex and threatening an additional 100 acres of wet meadow habitat. The gully network is a result of over a century of landscape manipulation including domestic water diversion, farming, ranching, and timber harvest. Yosemite and the Stanislaus National Forest jointly propose to reduce erosion and restore wetland functionality in the Ackerson Meadow complex.</p>

<p>The Half Dome cables will be up for the season on Wednesday, May 19, 2021! A permit is required to summit Half Dome. Most permits are available via preseason lottery, but a limited number are available every day, two days in advance. Additionally, all permits for May 19–May 27 will become available two days in advance. See <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/234652" id="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/234652|">https://www.recreation.gov/permits/234652</a> for details. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you will be hiking to Half Dome, be prepared with several liters of water, good hiking boots, and a headlamp (with extra batteries). Be prepared to turn around if a thunderstorm appears possible. Stay back from the Merced River, which is running high right now. If you see a bear on the trail or approaching you, scare it away by yelling loudly, aggressively, and persistently. Always keep your food within arm's reach. Oh, and have fun! </p>

<p><strong>April 23, 2021: </strong>It's a nice spring day today, but change is on the way! A winter storm warning is in effect early Sunday morning through Monday morning, with several inches of snow possible.</p>
<p>If you'll be visiting Sunday or Monday, be prepared for snowy conditions. Tire chains may be required (<a href="https://go.nps.gov/chains" id="https://go.nps.gov/chains|">https://go.nps.gov/chains</a>). Call 209/372-0200 (then 1, 1) to check on road conditions.</p>
<p>If you're planning a hike on Sunday or Monday, reconsider your plans and be prepared for freezing, wet, and slick conditions. A little snow can make a trail completely disappear, so have a map &amp; compass and know how to use them, even if you have GPS.</p>
<p>If you're not visiting, you can keep up on changing conditions by viewing Yosemite Conservancy's webcams at <a href="https://yosemite.org/webcams/half-dome/" id="https://yosemite.org/webcams/half-dome/|" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#myModal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-remote="/common/commonspot/customcf/modals/modal_intercept.cfm?targetURL=https%3A%2F%2Fyosemite.org%2Fwebcams%2Fhalf-dome%2F">https://yosemite.org/webcams/half-dome/</a></p>

<p><strong>April 15, 2021:</strong> Hard to believe it is already time to say goodbye to our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers as they migrate to their summer destination! Their last week brought spring snowflakes to the high country along with numerous signs of wildlife welcoming the change in seasons. Many spring migrant birds have returned and are singing their mating songs. The coyotes are howling in the meadows during the morning hours. And, bear tracks have been seen north of Tuolumne Meadows.

<p><strong>April 7, 2021:</strong> After a warm and dry week in Yosemite’s high county, our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers are starting to see more bare ground each day. The sound of wind has been replaced by the sound of running water as the Tuolumne River opens quickly and snow depths shrink. Despite the 33 inches of snow still measured at their weather plot, some sunny, south aspects below 9,000 feet are snow free. Don’t be fooled however, as the Tioga Road between Tuolumne Meadows and Crane Flat is still covered in snow; four feet deep in some places! It may feel like spring where you live, but in much of Yosemite’s higher elevations, winter is still evident.

<p><strong>March 25, 2021: </strong>For those of us at lower elevations it sure might seem that we’re well on our way into spring. However, our rangers in Tuolumne Meadows saw plenty of new snow and winter conditions this week. This will be good news for our snowpack even though it is still trending well below average. We’ll have a clearer picture on the snow water situation after they go out for the benchmark surveys in the coming week.Learn more and hear about one of their lovely wild neighbors. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-march-24-2021.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-march-24-2021.htm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>March 17, 2021:</strong> It was a wintry week in the mountains with snow in the high country as well as the lower elevations. Check out this week’s update from our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers to learn more about the mixed ski conditions in that area. Categorized as “mid-winter” like conditions, there are layers of powder, a firm melt-freeze crust, and some wet snow mixed in. Enjoy a quick lesson on trees in the high country as well, during a season when it’s much easier to see the forest for the trees against a backdrop of newly fallen snow. <a data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;-U&quot;}" data-lynx-mode="async" data-lynx-uri="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nps.gov%2Fyose%2Fblogs%2Fupdate-for-march-17-2021.htm%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR29i1KmXrzi_CIxA19PuPicDb_x2F-HI2DyR8YGgku0QsXB8QbPlsreAhQ&amp;h=AT3-3a7pS0n24IvrgFERcfzo5gJ6HsbTB7Tg1W_SDM-io5JuedzW71Y0w9yjwcCMyJAx9dI4BSuh9hHIYeW-lcTei31WcXtS8bPVPf2IptyQjSKY69ULlgWHXc1ueA5B-c5qNEVXqsrFRn099ivIkkWyPOKeO87MjfYagv0xfW-vqROJAj9FtMuBpyjp9JM_uLpAjRaQ3bn-fxPouS-CcLgxyYqca9nXKNlXe4sbGpmtEQlfm-uzvTAHJy0dmcWwF_R68DAB3ObphWQR4DDGOvIw8piGxTy-rDNP5xRxhJ6MNnND1o0bLBEnxp5w8zMUWf2atwVXU2AZVkmHj3VEfrYCzAslEkORFyDC4JV4EDxHbQhuCI3Xil1-ceAvIgfiiki4wGsfjNmiUsNFNI1w4GXQ25gifOwzVfU1oGX1CebKjNx8YkpZkvNDQWvKL6P0uPcfL97utkPGYx2Oz-Cka0iVpbfYIRIayuia0UBhvNvQDD8oldqLtY8BFnihqLYTXcyySlIlQP_MoxM8QGJvKGio27SS8UZ-2CqFv1dp4HpkwSUq1lFYDdg" href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-march-17-2021.htm" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/update-for-march-17-2021.htm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>February 10, 2021: </strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how geologists address rockfalls in Yosemite National Park?</p>
<p>Almost exactly eight years ago, in 2014, a rockfall fell from Glacier Point in the early morning hours of February 11, sending boulders towards Curry Village. One boulder landed squarely within the footprint of a visitor cabin. Had this cabin actually been there it would have been seriously damaged or even destroyed by the impact; if occupied, there likely would have been injuries and/or fatalities.</p>
<p>Instead, there were no consequences to this rockfall because this cabin was one of many that were moved in 2013, based on a study of rockfall hazard and risk in Yosemite Valley. Using tools such as laser mapping of cliffs, exposure dating of boulders, and three-dimensional rockfall modeling, scientists mapped rockfall zones throughout the Valley. Moving high-risk buildings to locations outside of hazardous areas is one way the National Park Service has increased safety. Park rangers have also developed emergency plans and may close trails or post warnings signs in areas where rockfall hazard is elevated.</p>

<p><strong>February 5, 2021: </strong>Shhhh...snowflake by snowflake, last week's winter storms laid a fresh blanket across a landscape deep in slumber. ❄️<br>
<br>
Winter provides a crucial chance for Yosemite to recharge and reset, keeping ecosystems in balance while building resilience to summer stressors like drought. But in recent years this restorative sleep has been cut short by rising temperatures, leading to changes that echo through the park's watersheds, wildfires, and living communities—including humans. What are the long-term consequences of environmental "sleep deprivation"?

<p><strong>January 4, 2021:</strong> Our Tuolumne Meadows winter rangers are back for their 10th season in the high country! As usual, they give us a weekly snapshot of current snow and avalanche conditions, wildlife activity and any other happenings above 8,000 feet. They have been enjoying the settled snow from recent weather systems in the area, with around two feet of snow in Tuolumne Meadows and another foot at higher elevations (likely more after today).

<p><strong>December 13, 2020: </strong>Any visit to the high Sierra might have the peace pierced with the raucous <i style="text-align: -webkit-match-parent;">kraak kraak kraak</i><span style="text-align: -webkit-match-parent;"> of a Clark’s nutcracker. These gray and black jays are members of the corvid family of birds, joined by crows and ravens. Nutcrackers are aptly named for their specialized beak capable of breaking open the toughest of cones, that of the Whitebark pine tree found only in the subalpine zones of western mountain ranges. Clark’s nutcrackers become inadvertent farmers of their favorite food source by storing hundreds of pine nuts, sometimes miles away from the source tree. Some nuts are never eaten and eventually turn into mature trees producing more cones.</span></p>
<p>Whitebark pine are a tree of importance for the subalpine zone by producing nutrient rich nuts, holding back snowmelt in the spring, and are an early succession plant after a fire. These trees are being monitored closely in the western mountains because many stands are dying back due to a native beetle and an introduced fungus.</p>
<p>You can read more about the relationship between Clark’s nutcrackers and Whitebark pine at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/whitebark-pine-and-clarks-nutcracker-mutualism.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/whitebark-pine-and-clarks-nutcracker-mutualism.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/whitebark-pine-and-clarks-nutcracker-mutualism.htm</a></p>

<p><strong>September 30, 2020: </strong>Have you ever visited the Yosemite Museum? If so, it’s likely that you’ve enjoyed seeing the beautiful baskets on display from our collection. Big and small, utilitarian in their purpose, or souvenirs for early tourists, baskets encompassed the artistry, creativity and skill the first women in Yosemite possessed.Baskets served many purposes in the lives and culture of Yosemite’s first peoples. They were used to carry goods, harvest seeds, sift grain, cook meals, and store belongings. They were used as game mats, bowls, jugs, racquets, pots, cradles, and eventually, as a source of income. Like many other traditions, basket weaving is an art that is still practiced today with techniques passing down from one generation to the next.Thanks to the support of the Yosemite Conservancy you can enjoy a virtual exhibit which focuses on Yosemite basketry.

<p><strong>September 13, 2020: </strong>Smoke from the Creek Fire and other wildfires continue to affect air quality in Yosemite National Park. The Creek Fire is currently at 201,908 acres and is 8% contained. Air quality can vary considerably from day to day and in different areas of the park. The air quality index for Yosemite today was “unhealthy” to “hazardous,” and forecast to remain that way tomorrow. When air quality is hazardous, you should avoid any outdoor activity.</p>

Thank you to all leaders, activists and everyday people that fought, and still fight, for gender equality.

If you're visiting in the near future, check webcams for a current view: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm" id="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm|">https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/photosmultimedia/webcams.htm</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Air quality in Yosemite Valley is currently moderate, meaning unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. Air quality may worsen; you can track air quality near Yosemite Valley at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/air/current-data.htm?site=yose" id="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/air/current-data.htm?site=yose|">https://www.nps.gov/subjects/air/current-data.htm?site=yose</a>. </p>
